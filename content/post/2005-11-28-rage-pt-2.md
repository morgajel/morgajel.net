so, you might have noticed my site has been acting oddly the last few weeks- I’ve found a bug with mod\_rewrite in my current setup. I’m not sure what or how or why it changed, I just know that sometime between Nov. 10th and 16th, mod\_rewrite stopped allowing implicit redirects that wordpress uses. I’ve since modified the .htaccess file to use explicit redirects, but it’s ugly as hell.  
until I figure out wtf is going on, that’ll have to work for now.
