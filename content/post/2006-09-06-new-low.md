So I just got hit with a new low…

Looks like I’m inelegible for unemployment. Apparently I haven’t been in michigan long enough to warrant helping me out. when I look back on my life, this will be the moment when I said “this is as bad as it got.”

I’m hoping it doesn’t get much worse at least.

The depression that I’m sitting in right how is the soul crushing type where you lose the will to do anything. Hell, I’m only writing this because I’m bored of playing disgaea 2- if that doesn’t tell you how bored I am, I don’t know what will.

So yeah, fuck you Sean. Fuck you for convincing me to trust you on this job.
