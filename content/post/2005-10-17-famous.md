well, almost. A few years back I had just finished working on a multi-threaded matrix multiplication project for a class, and jumping between that and bash scripting, which I was fairly new to at the time. I asked the following question in the #asp channel when I bounced back to writing ASP:

```


(morganj): 0 is false and 1 is true, correct?
(alec_eso): 1, morganj 
(morganj): bastard.
```

This quote made itâ€™s way to [bash.org](http://www.bash.org) where it was in the top 25 highest rated quotes for a long time. Alec\_eso recently informed me that it had made it into [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Boolean#boolean_joke) under the boolean talk page.

Made me feel sorta proud.
