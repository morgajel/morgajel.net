So Iâ€™ve been quiet the last few weeks- mainly because Iâ€™ve been keeping busy. As a lot of you know, I have many little side projects that I never seem to get done. So hereâ€™s a quick update:

â€“ Ruma has been put into stasis since the other devs donâ€™t have the free time and neither do I. if anyone wants to take up development of it, Iâ€™ll be happy to give them access.

â€“ opensourcecook.com got about halfway done and then I lost interest. I just couldnâ€™t get into designing the input forms for jackie, and she wasnâ€™t looking forward to having to manually re-enter her recipes.

â€“ Ian now has a guitar so, Iâ€™m trying to teach him how to be gentle with it. Itâ€™s a $30 first act guitar, so not a huge loss if he destroys it.

â€“ Iâ€™ve been working on an rpg battle engine in ruby and tinkering with gosu a bit. I doubt itâ€™ll go anywhere, but usually once every 6 months I debate creating it. Iâ€™m about to burn out on that as well.

The big news is jackie and I have been looking for a house for about 2 months now and we put an offer in on a house thatâ€™s about 10 minutes from work. The people have accepted our offer, but since itâ€™s for less than what they owe, they have to get the bank to agree to a [short sale](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_sale_%28real_estate%29). If they donâ€™t want to take the loss, weâ€™re sorta screwed and may end up looking elsewhere.

Since itâ€™s our first house, weâ€™re getting a [FHA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FHA_loan) loan to help us get the best deal. The big issue here is they can demand things be fixed (like a leaky roof) before they give the go-ahead. Since itâ€™s a short sale, the bank may not be willing to take more of a loss on the cost to have the repairs made.

Iâ€™m fairly optimistic about this house- itâ€™ll require very little work to give it livable (from what we see) and hopefully nothing will be wrong with it. Iâ€™d almost like to hear that the roof has another 5 years left on it since thatâ€™s our biggest concern. If it needs to be replaced the sellers may do it themselves to save costs and do a shoddy job.

The best part about this particular house is it has an unfinished basement, and Iâ€™ll be able to build a large office to house all my hobbies. Thatâ€™ll make jackie happy since they usually are messy or take up a lot of space. The bigger the office, the longer itâ€™ll take for the hobbies to spill into the rest of the house ðŸ™‚

Regardless of the outcome, a house in in the plans, so I added a new house category.
