real quick mention of http://del.icio.us/ – it’s a social bookmarking system- see a page you like? don’t like managing your bookmarks? check delicious out. you can see your friends bookmarks as well- so if someone has a page that you find useful bookmarked, you can check to see if they have any related bookmarks.

I like it for the fact that I move from computer to computer a lot and my bookmarks needs to be portable.
