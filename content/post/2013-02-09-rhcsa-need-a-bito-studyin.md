So now that I’m back at an employer that does consulting work, I am re-contemplating getting some certifications simply so I look more valuable on paper. I figure, what the hell, might as well look at an RHCE or RHCSA, so I googled around and found Redhat’s evaluation exam- Here’s the results from the 80 question evaluation:

I wish they provided more feedback on what questions I failed- I know that I botched a chunk of the yum, lvm and SELinux questions, but I don’t know which scripting and networking questions I failed. In either case, it’s not a bad starting point. With a good round of studying I’d imagine I should be able to tackle this test.
