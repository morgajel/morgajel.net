mmmm… one thing about being jobless and poor is I’m finding ways to save money. When jackie and I were in DC making lots of money and had no freetime, we ate out quite a bit. Now we’re looking for ways to cut costs and we’re looking for foods that we can make a batch of and eat over the course of the week- we can make a batch of stew and eat it for 3 or 4 days.

Stew is pretty good, but the shocker was burritos- I haven’t made homemade burritos in a year or two and forgot how cheap they were. on top of that if we make enough meat we can get it to last 3 or 4 meals easily for less than $20. Usually whenever we go out for a meal we spend $20-25, so this is a great deal.

On top of that, burritos are tasty- probably in my top 5 favorite foods. So what do we get?

- shells
- beans
- meat
- Lettuce
- tomatoes
- guacamole (homemade- avacado, garlic, cilantro, jalapeno, tomato, onion, lime juice, salt, pepper)
- sour cream
- cheese
- onions

I eat 2 medium sized burritos and I’m good to go for the rest of the night.
