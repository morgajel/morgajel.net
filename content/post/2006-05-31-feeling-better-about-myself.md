So I heard a neil young song on the radio the other day, the “new” one… it’s a anti-war protest song. Now, I’m not really fond of the current administration or the war, and I guess it’s sorta expected that a guy that played at woodstock would be against it, but I have a problem with this song.

He basically used the exact same tempo and beat from “rockin in the free world”. Completely ripped it off. I mean, I know the original was his, so he’s entitled to, but it just seems lazy. Now, I’m sure there’s a bit of irony in there somewhere that he’s protesting a war who’s supposed purpose is to overthrow a dictator and bring in democratic elections, but that’s not what I care about.

What I care about is this-  
\* Neil Young can’t sing. I don’t think anyone will disagree there.  
\* Neil Young isn’t that good of a guitarist. Listen to the riffs from free world and this new song. Sloppy and very boring.  
\* Neil Young isn’t that good of a writer. read the new lyrics:

```

Back in the days of "mission accomplished"
Our chief was landing on the deck
The sun was setting on a golden photo op
Back in the days of "mission accomplished"
```

Not exactly inspiring for me. They actually feel pretty limp. Now, beyond all the political BS that this is wrapped up in, strictly from a musical point of view…

Why the hell in Neil Young so popular?

The reviews I read of this CD were all shouting “OMG he wants to impeach bush!!!” and not “this song is a good song, and here’s why.” The lyrics feel forced and clunky, the guitar is the same way, and as I mentioned earlier, the beat is recycled…

But anyways, the point of me writing this is to say that I feel better about myself. I’ve been trying to write these well thought out, composed songs with reasonable lyrics and a nice hook. I see that to get a song on the radio, you don’t really need good lyrics, excellent musicianship, or even talent. I thought that was confined to pop music, but I guess I was wrong. Thanks Neil Young for cluing me in!
