This happened a month or 3 back and I forgot to post it. we enjoy harassing each other, and I felt the need to share this with the rest of the world‚Ä¶

in #asp:  
08:26 &lt; CoolGui&gt; dude  
08:26 &lt; CoolGui&gt; I‚Äôve had a fever since saturday  
08:26 &lt; CoolGui&gt; Now I have these stomach cramps that won‚Äôt go away  
08:27 &lt; CoolGui&gt; And all the doctor did was tell me it was probably a virus and call him if I didn‚Äôt feel better in a couple of days. üôÅ  
08:27 &lt; morgWork&gt; remember, whatever doesn‚Äôt kill you may just make you blind and crazy.  
08:27 &lt; morgWork&gt; i.e. it could be siphilus  
08:28 &lt; CoolGui&gt; That‚Äôs what I wanted to hear. üòõ  
08:29 &lt; CoolGui&gt; Can you get syphilis without having sexual contact to an infected person?  
08:29 &lt; morgWork&gt; yes  
08:29 &lt; morgWork&gt; I‚Äôm pretty sure  
08:30 &lt; CoolGui&gt; google sent me here  
08:30 &lt; CoolGui&gt; http://www.cdc.gov/std/Syphilis/STDFact-Syphilis.htm#WhatIs  
08:30 &lt; morgWork&gt; you see the part about pustules?  
08:36 &lt; CoolGui&gt; sounds nasty. I don‚Äôt think I have that.  
08:37 &lt; LanShark&gt; dude  
08:37 &lt; LanShark&gt; you jsut came back from europe  
08:37 &lt; LanShark&gt; thats what you get  
08:38 &lt; CoolGui&gt; I was fine over there  
08:38 &lt; LanShark&gt; sure you were  
08:38 &lt; CoolGui&gt; I think it was because I drank the water on the plane  
08:38 &lt; CoolGui&gt; You know, the community water fountain  
08:38 &lt; LanShark&gt; let me find the quote  
08:38 &lt; CoolGui&gt; I‚Äôve heard bad things about water on planes, now I‚Äôm starting to think it got me  
08:39 &lt; LanShark&gt; \[2006-08-18 15:51:18\] &lt;yojimbo |work&gt; CoolGui: Looks like it‚Äôs your turn to get baked and wake up naked in an alley with a disease you can‚Äôt pronounce  
08:39 &lt; LanShark&gt; hahahahahahahahaha  
08:40 &lt; CoolGui&gt; haha.. yeah.. well I think it‚Äôs just a virus or bacteria or something  
08:40 &lt; CoolGui&gt; Hopefully not a parasite  
08:41 &lt; CoolGui&gt; I swear I think it came on in 6 hours or so though‚Ä¶ so that eliminates most viruses that I know of‚Ä¶ A lot of bacterial infections come on that quick though.  
08:41 &lt; CoolGui&gt; Fuckin doctor didn‚Äôt feel the need to give me antibiotics though.  
08:43 &lt; CoolGui&gt; hmm‚Ä¶ Honestly it sounds like Staphylococcus aureus  
08:43 &lt; CoolGui&gt; Doesn‚Äôt say drinking water there  
08:43 &lt; CoolGui&gt; But it does have the short incubation period  
08:44 &lt; CoolGui&gt; well it says that one usually only lasts up to 24 hours‚Ä¶. so probably not it  
08:44 &lt; CoolGui&gt; could be salmonella though  
08:44 &lt; morgWork&gt; CoolGui: make sure you‚Äôre not going blind‚Ä¶  
08:45 &lt; CoolGui&gt; I can see okay  
08:47 &lt; morgWork&gt; for now  
08:50 &lt; CoolGui&gt; I have some antibiotics laying around I think I‚Äôm going to take them anyway  
08:51 &lt; morgWork&gt; bad move slick  
08:51 &lt; CoolGui&gt; don‚Äôt call me slick!  
08:51 &lt; morgWork&gt; your syphilis will become resistant because you won‚Äôt take enough  
08:51 &lt; CoolGui&gt; lol, it‚Äôs not syphilis  
08:51 &lt; morgWork&gt; then you‚Äôll have resistant syphilis.  
08:53 &lt; CoolGui&gt; I have amoxocillin, penicillin and something else  
09:00 &lt; CoolGui&gt; This stuff expired almost a year ago  
09:01 &lt; CoolGui&gt; I have one digital thermometer that reports 101.2 and another that reports 99.9  
09:01 &lt; CoolGui&gt; that‚Äôs a big fucking difference if you ask me  
09:27 -!- alec\_eso \[~na@c-66-177-247-68.hsd1.fl.comcast.net\] has joined #ASP  
09:32 &lt; morgWork&gt; alec\_eso: perhaps you can diagnose CoolGui  
09:32 &lt; morgWork&gt; he was in amsterdam and now has a fever

I then message alec\_eso  
09:32 &lt; morgWork &gt; say it‚Äôs syphilis  
and paste him the conversation up to this point

in #asp:  
09:33 &lt; alec\_eso&gt; that sounds like syphilis  
09:33 -!- CooIGui \[~CoolGui@cpe-24-167-19-99.houston.res.rr.com\] has joined #ASP  
09:34 &lt; morgWork&gt; CooIGui: damnit, you missed it  
09:34 &lt; CooIGui&gt; sorry  
09:34 &lt; morgWork&gt; CooIGui: please explain your sickness to dr alec\_eso  
09:35 &lt; CooIGui&gt; Had to reboot ye olde router  
09:35 &lt; morgWork&gt; note that he is only a doctor of funk, not a medical doctor  
09:35 &lt; CooIGui&gt; fever, headache, abdominal cramps, light sensitivity  
09:35 &lt; CooIGui&gt; okay  
09:35 &lt; alec\_eso&gt; how long?  
09:36 &lt; CooIGui&gt; 3 days  
09:36 &lt; CooIGui&gt; well I‚Äôm on my 3rd day  
09:36 &lt; alec\_eso&gt; have you had any unprotected sex in the week prior?  
09:37 &lt; CooIGui&gt; no  
09:37 &lt; alec\_eso&gt; have you used public toilets? unfamiliar toilets?  
09:37 &lt; CooIGui&gt; yes  
09:38 &lt; alec\_eso&gt; where?  
09:38 &lt; alec\_eso&gt; any itching, swelling, painful urination? been going regularly?  
09:38 &lt; CooIGui&gt; no  
09:39 &lt; CooIGui&gt; er.. no and yes  
09:39 &lt; alec\_eso&gt; when you used those toilets, you use the paper covers?  
09:40 &lt; LanShark&gt; hell no  
09:40 &lt; alec\_eso&gt; because if not it sounds like you have Capone‚Äôs Syndrome  
09:41 -!- CoolGui \[~CoolGui@coolgui.users.undernet.org\] has quit \[Read error: Operation timed out\]

alec eso then messages me this:  
09:41 &lt;alec\_eso&gt; I told him Capone‚Äôs Syndrome  
09:41 &lt;/alec\_eso&gt;&lt;alec\_eso&gt; (al capone died of syphilis in prison)  
09:44 &lt;morgwork&gt; lol  
09:44 &lt;/morgwork&gt;&lt;morgwork&gt; nice  
09:46 &lt;alec\_eso&gt; my next step is for me to get him to take a digital picture of his genitals so I can do a visual exam to rule in or out syphilis  
09:47 &lt;morgwork&gt; lol

in #asp:  
09:47 &lt; alec\_eso&gt; well, I gotta go to class  
09:48 &lt; alec\_eso&gt; if he asks tell him I think it‚Äôs syphilis  
09:48 &lt; alec\_eso&gt; tell him to get a video camera and start documenting his life like michael keaton in my life because he won‚Äôt be around for his kids  
09:49 &lt; LanShark&gt; wheres yojimbo, he gets the win if youre right  
09:49 &lt; morgWork&gt; alec\_eso: will do
