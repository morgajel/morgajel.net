I finally let go of draccus.net.

it was a sad day. I’ve not used it in over a year, and it’s just sat unused. I’ve replaced it with morgajel.net for the most part. I figured it was time to move on.

So what’s the history of draccus.net? well, it was the first domain I ever bought. it was my first real website. It was there when I was hosting on my CSIS account, it was there when I set up my first list server at Brookmeadow, and it was there when I proposed to jackie. Lotta history there. I’ve still got all of the data that was on it, and maybe I’ll bother going through and back-log posting it.  
eh, we’ll see.

draccus.net is dead. long live morgajel.net.
