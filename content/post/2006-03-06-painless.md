I caught a [security notice about wordpress](http://www.gentoo.org/security/en/glsa/glsa-200603-01.xml) and decided to take the plunge and upgrade to 2.0.1. After the crap with midi I put up with this weekend, I wasn’t too fond of messing with anything. I bit the bullet and went through with it tho, and the result was painless. I’m using webapp-config and virtual hosts, so there was a bit of an extra step:

- emerge –ask –oneshot –verbose “&gt;=www-apps/wordpress-2.0.1”

- webapp-config -U -h morgajel.net -d wordpress wordpress 2.0.1

when this ran smoothly, I loaded up the page and noticed some errors in the sidebar. I loaded the site admin section, thinking I could find out more here when I was greeted with a “You have to upgrade the database” message. I clicked next, expecting a long complex process that was going to make me curse like a sailor. Instead I’m greeted with a “well, there was really only one step. you’re all done!” message.

Everything seems to be working great now. Not too fond of the new ‘write post’ interface, but I’ll get used to it. If this article works, it’ll be my first successful posting with WP 2.x
