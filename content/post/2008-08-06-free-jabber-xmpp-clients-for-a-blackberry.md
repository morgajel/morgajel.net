anyone know of any good jabber clients for the blackberry? Iâ€™ve tried a couple with little luck, and most of them cost more than I can afford for this test. Features required

- Must run on BlackBerry 8703e v4.1.0x
- Connection server can be configured differently than jid address (i.e. you@morgajel.net for jid, jabber.morgajel.net for connection server.) This rules out Mobber as far as I can tell
- Requires SSL/TLS
- Non-strict cert checking

Let me know if you have any suggestions.
