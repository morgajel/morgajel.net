title: Reimaging my Phone

So after the failure of Paranoid Android, I’m switching back to the Cyanogenmod 10.2.1 rom for my galaxy nexus. I figured I’d document the steps since they were so irksome in the hopes that someone can help me streamline this.

- Create a backup of most of my apps and their configurations with Titanium Backup.
- Download the proper google apps and cm rom for my phone
- choose to install rom, apps and backup via clockwork mod’s ROM Manager
- reboot and wait for magic to happen.

After that, the fun begins

- Go through installation process, which includes typing my Google account password twice (hint, it’s very long and difficult to type of a phone keyboard).
- Add wireless passphrase
- enter a verification code. Since I don’t have google auth set up, I have to use one of my backup codes.
- skip or log into the CM backup account stuff (I finally set it up this time.)

ok, phone is now usable, but is still irksome.

- Fire up gmail app, go to settings, click on morgajel@gmail account, inbox sound and vibrate, sound, complete action using media storage (always), select none, then ok. ensure vibrate is off.
- Go to the phone’s system settings, click on Lock screen, 
    - screen security, screen lock 
        - pattern and set pattern
        - set owner info, set show owner info on lock screen
    - Background Image, select image
- settings-&gt;interface-&gt;status bar-&gt;Battery status style-&gt; percentage
- settings-&gt;sound-&gt;phone ringtone -&gt; orion
- settings-&gt;sound-&gt;Vibrate when ringing
- Force stop and disable apollo so that it won’t interfere with my bluetooth app and beyondpod.
- reconfigure google authenticator for google account
- reconfigure google authenticator for github account
- reconfigure google authenticator for dropbox account
- set up twitter account
- set up linkedin account
- set up github account
- set up facebook account
- set up dropbox account.
- reconfigure google voice
- set up amazon kindle account
- reconfigure bluetooth for my car
- remember facebook has annoying notifications, wonder why I enabled it, then go to settings and disable vibrate, LED and set ringtone to none

To do:

- Set up Corporate email account
- set up skype account
- reconfigure google authenticator for linode account
- reconfigure bluetooth for Jackie’s car

I’m sure there’s a dozen other things that still need to be done.
