So I’ve been using the M5 for the last few days and have been pretty impressed. I missed a few days due to a long holiday weekend, but the last few days I’ve been on it.

I still haven’t read the manual- I need to check the CD tonight. It’s still broken on their site… Actually, I could just check google’s cache of the [ iAudio M5 mamual](http://64.233.179.104/search?q=cache:joNSABtbBbIJ:eng.iaudio.com/download/file/manual/iAUDIOM5/M5_Eng_manual_2.0.pdf+&hl=en&gl=us&ct=clnk&cd=1&client=firefox-a). I think I’ll do that now.

As it stands now, I’m 90% sure I’m going to buy one for myself. I haven’t used a portable music player since my CD player my freshman year of college, and a cassette player in high school before that.

Something else I’ve noticed- it’s more masculine than the ipod. It’s metal and shiny, where as the ipod looks like a femine hygene product. That amuses me on some level.
