So a coworker just shared a fun story with me- His bank, we’ll call it Pursue Bank, had a nice little glitch in their payment system. when he tried to change how he paid his mortgage. Said bank then charged him not one, not two, but three mortgage payments against his checking account. Then charged him overdraft fees.

It’s nice to see someone else suffer from the bad code issues that I see on a weekly basis. The only downside is my mortgage is also through said company. Jackie and I have been thinking about refinancing since our interest rate could be a bit lower, so this was a good kick in the rear to get away from these guys.
