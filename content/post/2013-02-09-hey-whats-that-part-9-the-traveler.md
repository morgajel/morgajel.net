Lets look at another type of [location generation](http://morgajel.net/2013/02/02/1313 "Hey, what’s that? Part 1: The Ruins"): the Traveler. There are lots of travelers on the road these days. Perhaps its a traveling merchant, or a dignitary, or a messenger. Perhaps it’s a god or dragon in human form. Maybe a gypsy or a caravan; traveling circus or conmen. Perhaps it’s a mercenary who’s lost returning from a botched job. Maybe its a tax collector with a load of cash. Perhaps there’s rumors of highwaymen. They could be on foot, horseback, wagon, or something more unique. How are they dressed- rich, poor, strange? Are they pale, tanned, barbaric, civilized, filthy? any religious markings?

> During your travels, you run across \[fellow travelers/a fellow traveler\] \[heading the same way/the other way/at a crossroad/stopped by the road\]. From the look of their clothing, you’d guess they are \[a beggar/merchant/adventurer/dignitary/messenger/etc\]. A careful eye picks up \[thievescant/a holy symbol/a noble’s ring\]. Their general attitude seems to be \[jovial/hurried/upset/scared/demoralized\].

> When they see you they \[don’t seem to care/become nervous/cautious/defensive/hostile\]. They appear \[mildy/hardly/overly\] \[unconcerned/paranoid/protective\] of their possessions.The traveler\[s\] look \[exhausted\], \[unuse/use\] to the dangers of travel. \[He/She/They\] appear to have been on the road \[for some time/for merely hours/for days\] and are \[close/far/near\] their destination. The \[cart/horse/caravan/wagon\] that they’re traveling with seems \[worn/new/expensive\].

I just realized that a “spoiler” section would be a cool addition- DM notes that are hidden by default.
