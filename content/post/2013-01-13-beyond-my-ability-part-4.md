So, a major update. I reached out to both amitp and rhill to better understand their codebases and was able to get a rough map implementation in. After hours upon hours of grueling work, I now have not one, but three maps for use with my city generator- a continent map, a region map, and a city map.

Still a lot of work left, but itâ€™s looking pretty good.
