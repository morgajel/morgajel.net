So after 3 months of unemployment, I was offered a job over in Troy, so I’ll be moving about 3 hours away from Grand Rapids. The position is for a linux sys admin. Unlike the last place, this one seems like a winner from the get go- much more lively and has a (for lack of a better term) DC vitality, compared to companies in Grand Rapids which sort of feel like they’re recycling coffee grounds and requesting employees bring in their own toilet paper.

I love Grand Rapids, I really do, but for cryin out loud it’s a dead area. I’ve tried to make it work, but this was the last chance. I’m really not planning on coming back (unless there’s a MAJOR change going on). It’s time I move on, get a good job with a stable company, and get a house. Jackie and I are sticking by our “1 year in apartment, then get a house” rule, so we’re looking for a decent sized apartment in the area- preferrably a townhouse with a finished basement and a back yard.

I’ll keep you up to date on developments with the new job.
