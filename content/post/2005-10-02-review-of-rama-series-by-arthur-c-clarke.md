The series started with *Rendezvous with Rama*, going on to *Rama II*, *The Garden of Rama* and *Rama Revealed*.

Since I’m feeling lazy, I’m not gonna write a pretentious review about how the style of the first book was different/better/worse than the following books. The series as a whole was pretty decent, lot of things made you think about how humanity as a whole will probably be cleansed when they meet another intelligent species because they’re too stupid to just be civil.

If you like the first book, you probably won’t like the following three. if you don’t like the first book, you should give the next 3 a chance. Keep an open mind and try to follow it all the way through. The ending is worth it.

I’d give the series as a whole 7/10.
