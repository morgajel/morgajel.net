I’m claiming the win on this one… remember that the tinyURL that this bot messages is in fact a link to tubgirl.

15:18  we dont want any chowda heads in here
15:25  "chowda head"...I don't know why that just caused a really really bad "yo momma"
         joke to pop in my head
15:28  I just googled "chowda head" for the heck of it.  This site is pretty funny...

15:28  Chowdahead
15:32  !search Chowdahead

15:38  it can't be a coincidence that edmundo left immediately after the post to press alt 
         + z....twice
15:39  once is funny, twice is HILARIOUS
15:39  nevermind, one was a join.  jokes on me
15:39  Pats-Sox: you think it's funny, but you didn't even see what happens AFTERwards
15:39  the bot does send a link.
15:39  do I dare ask to what?
15:40  only one way to find out.
15:40  lol
15:41  Don't take it personally, but I'm not trusting you right now
15:42  what? after you've known me for 15 years? wait, thats someone else. I see your point
15:42  I'm thinking that a bot can't process the key combo because the key combo is 
        processed by the irc client, therefore exiting the channel before the bot can catch the key press
15:43  worst case scenario, I'm wrong, you pop out, pop back in, and I laugh like a retard.
15:44  if I'm right, the bot messages you and gives you the blue pill.
15:44  A normal key, z, could not possible work as well alt-F4.  It just can't.
15:46  pornocracy
15:47  Pats-Sox: only one way to find out
15:48  my do-not-push-the-red-button sign, let me show you it.
15:48  alright, I'll take one for the team....
