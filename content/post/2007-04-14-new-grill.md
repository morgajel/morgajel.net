FINALLY, after 4 years, I’ve got a grill again. The last time I had a grill, it was charcoal and at Brook Meadow. This time we’re going with basically a potbelly gas grill- small enough to be portable, big enough to grill 2 steaks.

Somewhere around here I have my old bbq grill utensils. Gotta find those then I’ll be having steak and pork for dinner.
