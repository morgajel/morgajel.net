I sent the following message to California Tortilla via their website. I hope they fulfill my request. I somehow doubt it, however.

> I require urgent assistance. I lived in the Arlington, VA area for 18 months and ate a BCCB almost every day for lunch. In 2006 I moved back to Michigan.
> 
> I miss the BCCB.
> 
> Please open a location in Troy, MI so I may once again enjoy a delicious BCCB. Preferably near the intersection of Stephenson Hwy and I-75.
