So jackie finally got around to putting her recipe book into tellico, a collection manager. Now she can export it to HTML and share it with everyone so she doesnâ€™t have to keep ripping a cookbook.zip file to CD and handing it to people.

**Update**  
The tellico db is gone, replaced with [opensourcecook.com](http://www.opensourcecook.com)
