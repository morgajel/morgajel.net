So it’s been several years now since I first created Ziggy, and as I’ve mentioned before, I’ll be writing this year’s NaNoWriMo about him. The storyline will mainly take place before any of the games he was in took place, however some of the events will be [retconned](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retcon) into place.

 I’m looking for bits of storyline and events from the DnD sessions, from IRC, and from the neverwinter nights module. (note at some point I need to decompile the module and strip out some of the backstory.) What actions, sayings, or responses did he have to others? what kind of trouble did he save you from or get you into?

Those of you who’ve dealt with ziggy, what do you remember?

Also note- I don’t plan on mentioning anyone else’s characters, however if you give me permission to, I’ll include them in cameo appearances.
