So I woke up at 2:30am with severe back pain- the stabbing kind that makes it so you can’t breathe unless you sit/stand up. When THEY WHO SHALL NOT BE NAMED hired me, they brought me down from Michigan and paid to have our stuff moved. Long story short, their movers of choice were incompetent, and it ended up taking a month to get my bed. Since we were dead broke, I couldn’t afford a spare, and the cats kept popping the air mattress. Nothing worse for your back than sleeping on the floor or an under-inflated air mattress.

Anyways, by the time I finally got my bed back, my back was horribly messed up. Pretty much every other night since then I wake up with back pain or sleep poorly because of it. We’re not quite in the position to be able to afford a new bed, but it’s definitely on the list.

Tonight was really bad. :/
