oh, Lotus Notes, how I hate thee. you make me happy that the place I’m working  
at is replacing you with exchange. wait, I’m happy to use a microsoft product? why yes, lotus notes is really that bad- It’s a festering piece of crap.

Here’a s brief breakdown of why I hate lotus notes:

**General**

- Written in java, but not cross platform
- Closed source (Hello, IBM? I thought you liked open source!)

**Windows Client**

- Can’t search doesn’t clearly paginate, or show what page you’re currently on when you have a lot of emails
- can’t select multiple messages to mark them as read
- super slow, written in java
- Dependent on windows client for certain features (accepting calendar invitations, syncing my blackberry, etc.)
- no right click to mark a message as read
0


**web client**

- clumsy
- java applets for controls
- no close button when viewing an email to get back to the inbox  
     reply button is not “automatic”- you have to use the menu
- not certified to work with this browser(firefox).
- no timestamp on WHEN emails came in, just dates.
- Where is the Forward button in the main screen? you have to open an email to forward it.
- crashes firefox while doing research for this article while I had 16 tabs open. 
    - crashes on calendar app
    - crashes on rich text

I’m sure I’ll find more reasons- as I identify them, I’ll add them below.
