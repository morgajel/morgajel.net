title: Hugo Migration
toc: false

Something's changed obviously- I've migrated from wordpress to Hugo, a static site builder, this means the 1000+ posts I've had are likely mangled, but I don't care. I'd like to start posting again, but I've been avoiding it because I can't stand wordpress any longer.

This will get prettier as I continue on.
