I do my best to avoid politics on this site because it’ll always piss someone off. I don’t like the bible-thumping direction the republican party has taken over the past decade or two, and I can’t stand the democrats demands that we give up personal freedoms to save the children.

I’m gonna talk about politics today because I’ve noticed something happening that’s so surreal I had to say something. I’ll use the names Candidate A, B, etc to represent the players in this little scenario.

After watching how the Michigan and Florida democratic primaries went down, I started to wonder if maybe there was an underlying conspiracy to guarantee those delegates to a certain candidate. Imagine the following scenario:

1. Candidate A has [supporters ](http://www.mlive.com/elections/index.ssf/2008/02/dingell_kildee_endorse_clinton.html) in [a position of power](http://www.freep.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20071108/NEWS06/711080408/1008) that helps move the state’s primary [forward](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/22054151/) on the primary schedule against party rules.
2. Candidate A has [connections](http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5hY742M_s1ttD_ycf2Zusn1o1fD3QD8URVVHG0) in The Party that disqualifies the state and have it’s delegates stripped in punishment.
3. Candidates make a pact not to campaign in the state. All act ashamed of the State’s behavior.
4. Candidates B,C,D, and E remove themselves from the ballot in deference to party rules, while Candidate A leaves their name on the ballot.
5. Candidate A gets the lion share of votes in the state since they’re not only the only one on the ballot, but any votes for names not on the ballot (B,C,D,E) are thrown out.
6. After everything is said and done, Candidate A [petitions](http://www.reuters.com/article/newsOne/idUSN2533575920080126) for the state’s delegates to be reinstated, essentially saying “the citizens shouldn’t be punished for the actions of their leadership”.
7. Candidate A’s connections in The Party [change their minds](http://www.sptimes.com/2008/02/17/Worldandnation/Clinton_adviser_argue.shtml) and decide to reinstate the delegates, essentially handing over the delegates to Candidate A with no competition.
8. The delegates handed over to Candidate A is enough to give them enough to get the nomination for the party.

We’ve seen everything except the last two steps. The sane thing would be for the democratic party to have a “redo” on their election and make it fair for all candidates. Anything less will be bad news.

I am curious to see how this turns out- I think that if this does play out like I’ve outlined and the American public figures it out, there’s a good chance the resulting disillusionment will result in a republican president.
