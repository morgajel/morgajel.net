title: 3d Printer Ahoy!

I’ve finally gotten the go-ahead to get a 3d printer. It’s something I’ve wanted for a long time, but I’m just now at the point where I can get into it. As I wait for my tax return, I’ve started learning how to use Freecad.

So far I’ve finished the following tutorials:

- https://www.freecadweb.org/wiki/Basic\_Part\_Design\_Tutorial
- https://www.freecadweb.org/wiki/Aeroplane
- https://www.freecadweb.org/wiki/Manual:Modeling\_for\_product\_design
- https://www.freecadweb.org/wiki/Sketcher\_tutorial (2017-03-26)

It’s taken a bit of time, but I’m slowly getting there. With any luck I’ll be fabricating parts with relative ease, then can move on to sculpting with blender.
