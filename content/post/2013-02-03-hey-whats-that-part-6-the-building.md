So what else can our [locationGenerator](http://morgajel.net/2013/02/02/1313 "Hey, what’s that? Part 1: The Ruins") describe? How about a building. Unlike ruins, buildings are usually inhabited or at least inhabitable. What you find will somewhat be determined by the type of building.

What kind of buildings can we have? pretty much anything that you could find in a small town or city is eligible. A simple farmhouse, a brothel, a tavern an Inn. Perhaps a trading post, fortress, windmill, waterwheel or castle. Is it still in use? What specie or species runs it? Is it magical or mundane, good or evil? dirty or clean? What does the surrounding area look like? Any items laying about?

> During your travels, you stumble across a \[small/medium/large\] \[farmhouse/brothel/tavern/inn/tradingpost/fortress/windmill/waterwheel/castle\] standing alone \[on a clutch of trees/in a field/by the road\]. It appears to be \[in decent repair/in disrepair/in good shape/immaculately clean/filthy/cobbled together\]. Around the \[farmhouse/etc\] you see various \[tools/barrels/carts/bones\] \[littered/stacked/strewn/organized\] around it.
