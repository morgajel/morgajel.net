So Jackie and I went and saw Serenity yesterday. It was… a very good movie. A lot of fellow geeks either love or absolutely hate the TV show Firefly and are transferring these feelings towards Serenity. I have one thing to say to all of you hatemongers.

Please. Give it a chance. Watch it with an open mind before you start bashing it. I know most of you haven’t seen it. You know, actually WATCH it before you comment on it. I saw someone comment that they wouldn’t watch it because the trailer seemed stupid. Well, the trailer was meant to attract the 15-25 crowd that have never heard of Firefly, so I guess you can make your own decisions on that. Overall Serenity did pretty well (Opening weekend-wise) from what I saw.

Anyways, on to the movie. I think the best part was towards the end when something bad happened, and I looked over at Jackie and saw her in tears. Not just sad movie tears, but tears of angish. You have to understand, Jackie thought Firefly was an ok show, but she didn’t have any type of emotional investment in it. I had to beg her to put down her book and watch an episode here and there so she could finish the series before the movie.

This scene hit her incredibly hard. She was still upset the next day. That takes skill on the part of the director/writer.

Anyways, it was an excellent movie. 9.5/10

R.I.P.

If hollywood turned out movies of this quality more often, I might even go to the theater more than twice a year.
