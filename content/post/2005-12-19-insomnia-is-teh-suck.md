so the cat woke me up at 2:50am hoarkin’ and I’ve been up since.

I’ve been having sleep problems since I was about 14. probably longer than that, but that’s roughly when I got my own room and could stay up half the night. it’s weird, like my clock is set for a 30 hour day with two 4 hour naps rather than 24 with 8 hours of sleep.

I have about 2 hours before I normally get up. I’m still somewhat tired and sore, but I really don’t have a choice. I guess I’ll try to finish my debian bible so I can move onto electronics.
