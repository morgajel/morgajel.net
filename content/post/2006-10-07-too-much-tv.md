So since I’ve been laid off, I’ve been watching a lot of TV in the background while keeping busy… seasons 2 and 3 of Deadwood, 4 and 5 of the Dead Zone, all of Invader Zim, Bones, Heroes, Grey’s Anatomy, Angel, Battlestar Galactica, My Name is Earl, Lost, etc.

That’s a Lot of TV. Of the shows that I’m going to keep track of this season, Lost, My Name is Earl, BSG, Bones, Grey’s Anatomy, and maybe 24 are on the list.

… That’s a lot of TV.
