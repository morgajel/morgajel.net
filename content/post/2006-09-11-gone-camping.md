So jackie and I have been planning on going camping for a few months now with Jordan, Brad, Beth and Erin.. Since it was already paid for, we went ahead and went. We had 2 spots at orchard beach state park in Manistee, MI- very nice place. The trip went something like this:

Friday:  
10:40 am, went shopping together, bought an assload of food.  
3 pm, got to manistee and checked in, put up our tents, and lounged  
6 pm, ate hotdogs  
8 pm, heavy rain started, found out the tent leaked

Saturday:  
7am, found out we fared better than jordan and bet as far as getting wet went. Scrambled eggs and bacon for breakfast  
stuff  
4 pm, went down to the beach  
6 pm, started a game of runebound (a boardgame), played until we had to eat. made a kickass fire that was way too hot  
9 pm, ate steak. fire was too hot and the sun went down quick.

Sunday:  
7 am, got up, started the fire. Jackie made pancakes on the camping stove.  
10 pm, started runebound early, ended up giving up cause the expansion game is just too long  
2 pm, brats ( I think)?  
7 pm, ate hamburgers  
8 pm, went to the beach again, froze my junk off.  
9 pm, helped jackie lose at poker. watched people play roulette shot checkers with vodka and water. quite amusing.  
3 am, stayed up talking to beth about all sorts of random things

Monday:  
7 am, burned the rest of the wood, had leftovers.  
9:40, left to go back to Grand Rapids. Poured on the way home and most of the rest of the day.

It was a lot of fun, and thereâ€™s talk of doing it again. Iâ€™m looking forward to it- the weekend after labor day worked well- it was chilly and rained a bit, but there were only 25 lots out of 165 filled. We ended up taking up 4 lots instead of two. ðŸ™‚ It was also a really good reset point for me; tomorrow Iâ€™m going to start fresh on the job search.  
So what did we learn from all of this?

**Wood is Expensive**  
Manistee has problems with a certain wood bore pest, so wood canâ€™t be brought in from outside the county. that means woodprices are high. we went through $70+ worth of wood.

**Toasted Twislers**  
soft and chewy twislers are good, but donâ€™t singe them or they taste like ass.

**Last Day Leftovers**  
Plan your meals well, but leave the last day for leftovers. worst case scenario, you go out to eat.

**Community Shopping**  
We spent way too much on food, and part of that was because we egged each other on. we didnâ€™t need 5 lbs of twislers, or 8 bags of chips, etc.

**Vented Tents are Cold**  
Jackie and my tent was mesh on the top with a fly that staked down over the top- since we were near the lake, the wind rushed in and froze us all night.

**Air Mattress**  
That ground is hard. I have a bad back. airmattress would have been good.

**Too-Hot Fire**  
a Fire can be too hot for cooking- make sure you keep it decent, but remember you gotta pull the food off the wire rack.

**Buckets**  
buckets are useful; bring one.

**Head Uphill**  
sleep with your head uphill or youâ€™ll have sinus problems.

**Shot Checkers**  
If you bring shot checkers, make sure you bring alcohol you like. (side note: I watched, I didnâ€™t participate)

**Night Cooking**  
Make sure you arenâ€™t trying to tell if meat is cooked or not if you cook at night. raw steak in the center is bad.

**Tenderize Meat**  
since you have cold meat sitting in the cooler, you might as well tenderize it.

**Jordan + Seasoning == bad**  
He killed some of the burgers with montreal steak seasoning:)

**Tarp Folds Under**  
we placed a tarp under our tent to help with ground condensation- make sure if the tarp is too big that you fold the edges under itself so water doesnâ€™t pool.

**Unhâ€¦ Unhâ€¦ weeeeeeeee**  
Make sure everyone gets the joke and sees the [video](http://www.albinoblacksheep.com/flash/dumbdinosaur)

**Rubber Shoes + Fire == bad**  
Keep your feet away from the fire if your shoes are rubber soled.

Anything else Iâ€™m missing?
