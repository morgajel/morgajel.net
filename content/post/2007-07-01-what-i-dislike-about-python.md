Since I began working on the Luma project, Iâ€™ve been playing a lot with Python, a language that Iâ€™ve been around for years but never bothered to learn. Since Luma is written in Python and Iâ€™m not on the team, I figured it was time to jump in feet first. Coming from a perl/php/ruby/java background, it wasnâ€™t a big leap to make.

However, the more I read and write, the less I like it. Some are minor complaints, while some are a bit larger. Iâ€™m gonna list them here as I think of them, from trivial to more important

\* **indentation** â€“ This is really an annoyance more than anything. If youâ€™re not aware, python is whitespace sensitive- rather than using curly braces, it uses indentation to show scope and what belongs where. Oh, and you better make sure to replace your tabs with spaces, otherwise youâ€™ll ned up with bizarre errors that are a pain in the ass to track down.

\* **debugging tools** â€“ This one is a bit more aggravating- I may not have found the equivalents to Data::Dumper or -w in perl, or .inspect in ruby, but that doesnâ€™t mean they donâ€™t exist. Iâ€™m sure Iâ€™ll find them in time. And for those of you who suggest using the python interpreter for debugging, that doesnâ€™t really work that well when examining a GUI app.  
\* **self** â€“ it seems really redundant that inside a class method, the first parameter you pass is self- in other languages Iâ€™ve used, self is so prevalent inside a class that itâ€™s implicitly expected, not explicitly stated.  
\* **non-object old-style objects** â€“ When is an object not an object? When itâ€™s an old style python object. Apparently the Python object setup is sorta broken- new-style objects are subclassed from an actual object class, while old-style arenâ€™t. People complain that Perlâ€™s OO was tacked on, but this seems far more kludgy.  
\* **super** â€“ related to the above point- new-style objects can use super, which requires being told which parent class it should be looking at (since python supports multiple inheritance). The problem is old-style classes do not, so if youâ€™re subclassing a module you didnâ€™t write which itself is subclassed, you may have to dig to figure out if you can use super or not. Old-style classes use a different method- you call ParentClass.method() and pass it self as the first parameter. I think this probably ties into the kludgy way self is handled. For more on super, check out [Pythonâ€™s Super being Harmful](http://fuhm.net/super-harmful/) (which goes way over my head).

\* **a line fails but it doesnâ€™t say why, it just stops**â€“ Iâ€™ve run into this problem while trying to debug code- take the following code for example:  
`<br></br>            print "in workerthreadadd- will it add? 1"<br></br>            searchResult = self.ldapServerObject.add_s(self.dn, self.modlist)<br></br>            print "in workerthreadadd- will it add? 2"<br></br>`  
The first line will print- the second one wonâ€™t. I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s going on in that ldapServerObject- I didnâ€™t write it, but thereâ€™s not stackdump or errors spewing out- it just stops. Now I have to go through and debug the object Iâ€™m calling to figure out why itâ€™s dying. (This isnâ€™t the actual code that gave me this problem. I canâ€™t remember what was doing it previously.)

That said Iâ€™m still gonna keep at it- I didnâ€™t learn perl overnight, nor ruby. I suspect python will take a while to grow on me. When I learned php it was great compared to java because it didnâ€™t need to be compiled; when I learned perl it handled text and gui interfaces better than php; when I learned ruby itâ€™s OO abilities were far greater than perlâ€™s. I just have to figure out what itâ€™s good at that ruby and perl arenâ€™t.

**update**:  
It looks like the old vs. new style objects will be gone in python 3.0- theyâ€™re planning on switching to new-style only. I think itâ€™ll be a positive step overall, but after talking to the guys in #python, python 3.0 is much like Perl 6- it should be here sometime within the next decade, but I probably shouldnâ€™t even narrow it down that much ðŸ™‚
