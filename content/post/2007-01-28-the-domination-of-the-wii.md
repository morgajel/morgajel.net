So for those who have not been initiated, the Wii is the new Nintendo console. The cool thing about this console that makes it stand out is the motion sensitive controller. It adds a whole new dimension to gaming.

I stopped being a big console player after the failure of the Atari Jaguar around 1994- it was a big disappointment for me. The next console I got was a PS2 in 2001 or so- I even waited an extra year to make sure it wouldn’t be a failure. The Wii however, has gotten me excited about gaming in a way I haven’t been in a while.

The launch of the Wii dominated the PS3- it was perfectly marketed, had twice as many units as the PS3, and has been sold out for 2 months. Last weekend Target, Circuit City, Best Buy and the like all got new shipments of the Wiis in, and put them out on a Sunday. Within two hours they were all sold out. Jackie and I got to Target 5 minutes after opening and were 39th in line for 55 Wiis. We picked up a Wii, a classic controller, and two games- Rayman Raving Rabbids and Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess. I’ve been playing them both for about a week and they’re both pretty fun.

I started looking into what other games were available for the Wii and was shocked by the number of games that will be released in the next year that look interesting.

- Metal Slug anthology
- Excite Truck
- Super Paper Mario
- Mario Party 8
- SSX Blur
- Wii Play
- Wii Music
- Warioware Smooth Moves
- Super Mario Galaxy
- Spore (if it makes it to the wii)
- Red Steel
- Metroid Prime 3: Corruption
- Dragon Quest Swords
- Devil Kings

I’m not sure how many I’ll actually get, but it’s good to have options- it reminds me of the good old days of the super nintendo. The price is good (250), it has a lot of interesting and fun titles, free online play, and will give you a good workout with it’s motion-sensitive controller. Go buy one (if you can find one).
