Well, I’ve got this turd polished well enough to release [Ziggy 1.0.](http://morgajel.com/projects/perl/ziggy-1.0.tar.gz) There’s still a lot left to do, and a lot more to add, but this is a good place for people to start looking at it.

Feel free to download it and take him apart- I’ve included the very truncated Dribbly.xml profile (dribbly is surly, be forewarned) and kept ziggy’s real config under wraps. enjoy!
