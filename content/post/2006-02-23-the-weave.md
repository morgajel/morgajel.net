I ride a shuttle bus to work every day- the type with a driver and passenger seats, then 2 rows of 2 seats stretching the length of the bus, with a door on on side of the first row of seats.

Every day, I watch people scramble to be the first ones off the bus- they’re smart enough to stay seated until it’s their row’s turn, but then they start jockying to get out before the people across from them.

The sad part is not that they do this; it’s sort of human nature- what’s sad is I get mad at them for not doing the most optimal thing- The Weave. Observe:

The blue is the door, and the black is a half railing. If people got off in the order listed there, it would be the most efficient- people on the inside rows should fo first. After both of the inside people go, the outside people should go, following the same order as the inside people- this allows #5 to move to #3’s spot as #4 gets out of the way. by the time #4 has went, #6 has moved to #4’s old seat and can follow. It provides a rythm, and is sustainable on an arbitrarily long bus.

Now, I don’t know whether this is a good thing or not, but it’s how my mind works. I see patterns like this.
