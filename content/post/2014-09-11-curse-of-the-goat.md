I’m not sure why the idea hit me, but my brain has focused on it and it won’t let me move on until I write it down.

# Curse of the Goat

When afflicted, a goat appears from nowhere and proceeds to follow you around, constantly bleating. The goat is immortal, never sleeps, and cannot be lost. It will keep you awake, give away your position, and generally be annoying. If pushed off a cliff or otherwise separated, it will reappear within minutes, often headbutting the afflicted from behind.

> “Maeh-eh-eh-eht… Maeh-eh-eh-eht.”

## Variations

**Curse of the Golden Goat** – The only way to silence the goat is to feed it gold coins; a gold coin will by you 10 minutes of silence.

**Curse of the Ghost Goat** – The goat is incorporeal. Can’t be locked in another room, can’t be used to wedge a door closed, and spooks living animals.

**Curse of the Silent Goat** – It doesn’t bleat, it just stares at you and makes you feel bad about your life choices. Seen as an ill omen.
