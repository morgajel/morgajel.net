I’d just like to state, for the record, that I will never, EVER, E\_V\_E\_R buy anything from the spam that I get in my inbox. So spammers, if you’re paying attention, you can remove every single account @morgajel.com because they all come to me and I’m not buying anything.

So leave me alone and quit sucking my bandwidth.
