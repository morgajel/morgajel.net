So my father in law has been going on for years about how great Ameritech/ SBC/ AT&amp;T’s new broadband service is gonna be once it was activated. I personally like the idea of having fiber to the curb, so I’ve been looking forward to it for a while.

A few months back they sent a rep out to let us know they were offering ‘U-verse’ in our area. I wasn’t home at the time, so Jackie got information and said I’d get back to them. I didn’t bother since we’re looking for a house. I figure I can look them up after we find a house.

Well, they came back Wednesday. They had already been by when I got home, and Jackie told them to come back later. I hadn’t been in the door more than 20 minutes when they knocked again. I then listened to them go through their spiel about how they were going to save me money by charging me more per month than I was paying already. ($30 phone+ $30 DSL + $15 static IP

4. The fact that NO ONE seemed to know what a static IP was
5. The sales rep was given the run around just like us customers
6. They apparently don’t offer this very simple service
7. The fact that most of the support people couldn’t find this information
8. They charge $15/mo whereas Jasnet charged a one-time $15 fee
9. That the sales rep probably misled me to get the sale so he could get a comission
So, if anyone knows of an ISP in Madison Heights, MI that offers a static IP, decent upload speed, no blocked ports all at a decent price, please let me know.
