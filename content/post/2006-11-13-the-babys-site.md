Jackie and I finally agreed on a name a week or three ago- “Ian Hawthorn Morgan”. We also bought the domain [IanHawthorn.com](http://ianhawthorn.com/) for him- figured it was something he could take over when he’s old enough- it’s also gonna serve as a news center for family and friends. Jackie’s already set up a wordpress theme and started posting emails we’ve received and other such details.

I’ve revised my categories on this site and added one for ian when I mention him.
