So I crossed the 50k word finish line 9 days into NaNoWriMo. How did I do it so quickly?

1. Have a great, well developed main character in mind
2. Spend October writing an outline- a gigantic, 12 section outline with 10 bullets under each point that covers 6k words and has a glossary containing all characters and locations mentioned in the book and a 10 word description of each
3. Take the first week of November off of work
4. Have an understanding spouse who gets that you are compelled to do this.

I’m sure there’s more to it, but damn, I’m too excited right now to go into more detail, but as of 9pm on the 9th, I have 50298 words.

WOOT.
