This will be a short review; buy it.

What do you need to know about it? It’s a Zelda game, so the standard running around and stabbing things applies. You collect new items, piece together an artifact, and kill the bad guy. I haven’t gotten all the way though the game, but I have put in enough time to realize it’s pretty big.

The controls make good use of the wii remote and nunchuck. They get bonus points for the fishing controls- the remote is the pole and the nunchuck as the reel handle. The remote even makes the reel sound with the little speaker.

Overall the important thing is it’s a fun game, and it’s one every wii owner should get.
