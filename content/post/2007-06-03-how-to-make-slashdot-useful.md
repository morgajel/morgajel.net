Slashdot is full of random crap, cliches and trolls- but buried deep within this pile of refuse is some useful and interesting info waiting to get out. The following is my checklist to find the relevant posts:

1\) only read stories that actually look interesting. It seems like a simple thing, but it’s completely overlooked. As heart-warming as it is to read about them [recovering Scotty’s ashes](http://science.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/05/19/1247222), it’ll be a waste of half an hour reading the same old rehashed star trek jokes.  
2\) Log in. Slashdot has quite a bit of filtering capability, but you have to log in to use it.  
3\) Funny is a distraction- in my preferences, I assign funny a -6 modifier because I don’t want to be entertained. if I wanted to be entertained, I’d go to fark.  
4\) interesting, informative and insightful are what we’re looking for- I give them a +2 to put them above the rest of the cruft.  
5\) Flamebait, Troll and redundant get a -3. The less things are repeated, the more useful info you’ll get. If something is incorrectly marked as flamebait or troll because it’s a dissenting viewpoint, usually a reply to it will be highly rated; see rule #7.  
6\) Threshold 2- This keeps the boring and uninteresting posts out of the thread entirely unless you click “read parent”  
6\) Highlight threshold 3- This keeps the boring and uninteresting posts hidden, while the more interesting posts are visible.  
7\) read follow-ups and parents of interesting posts. Sometimes the response is more interesting than the post you found, or if nothing else, balances out false statements.

This isn’t a surefire list- yes, I’ll miss some good content, and no it doesn’t filter out all the crap, but it has improved my reading experience quite a bit. And yes, there still is some good info on slashdot- take for example, this article about what [Linus thinks of Subversion and Git](http://developers.slashdot.org/developers/07/06/03/004214.shtml). On the outside it looks like an opinion piece, but once properly filtered, there’s quite a bit of good information about what is wrong with cvs, the difference between git and svn, and how to use git in general.
