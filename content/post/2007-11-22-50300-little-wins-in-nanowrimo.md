At 11:50pm on the 21st of November, I completed the NaNoWriMo challenge, writing 50,300 words for my book, [Sinblade](http://www.nanowrimo.org/eng/user/243541). Iâ€™m not done yet- I still have another 5-10k words to go before Iâ€™ll consider the rough draft complete. Hereâ€™s my ideal lifecycle for the book:

- **Rough Draft:** First complete version of the story.
- **First Draft:** First revised version I send out for people to read. Continuity and plot are checked.
- **Second Draft:** All first draft changes are merged. English is checked. Plot is evened out. Facts are checked.
- **Third Draft:** Spell-checking, punctuation, and formatting.
- **Fourth Draft:** Repeat of third draft with different audience.
- **Final Draft:** Whatâ€™s sent to Lulu.com for printing.

My goal is to get the Rough Draft done by December 1st, and that seems a easily reachable goal. Next is to get the First Draft (the first copy to leave the house) out the door for editing and revising by the end of December. Iâ€™m not sure how reasonable a goal that will be- I have some catching up to do on my neglected Ruma project. As for the rest of the draft, there are no hard and fast rules- I suspect Iâ€™ll be lucky to get to the second draft, let alone the third or fourth.

The end goal is to self-publish through Lulu.com, a print-on-demand book service. This means youâ€™ll be able to buy an actual paperback copy of my book! How cool is that?

Seeing as how itâ€™s now 40 minutes into Thanksgiving, I think I should send out some thanks to those that have helped me:

- **Jackie:** for bearing with me through another time-consuming project. Hopefully this one will make money.
- **Ian:** for mostly behaving when I was trying to write.
- **VP:** for encouraging me to compete in NaNoWriMo with his books, [Shining Star](http://www.lulu.com/content/177354) and [Pulling Strings](http://www.lulu.com/content/212525)
- **yojimbo, dev\_null, mylo, my coworkers, and everyone else who offered to help me:** Iâ€™ll be taking you up on your offers to help revise ðŸ™‚

Thanks again everyone for the support! Wish me luck!

Update: Donâ€™t take this post as an example of my writing- it was 1am.
