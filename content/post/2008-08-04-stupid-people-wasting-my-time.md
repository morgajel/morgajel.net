ok, this has been gnawing at me for the last few weeks. As I get older I become a lot less patient with people who waste my time on stupid things. I try not to get involved with religious or political debates mainly because they always seem to lead to hurt feelings and me putting someone on a life-long banlist.

However.

I’m getting \*really\* pissed at the anti-science bullshit that’s going on. I’ve made the unfortunate mistake of reading [Bad Astronomy](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/) and <a href="">Angry Astronomer</a> as of late. It’s straight up madness. This shouldn’t be happening in the 21st century. What am I talking about? Well, let’s see here:

- People pushing creationism in science classes who can’t comprehend that creationism IS NOT SCIENCE BECAUSE IT HAS NO TESTABLE HYPOTHESIS AND CANNOT BE FALSIFIABLE. JUST SHUT UP. Come back when you have a real theory. I fear the day my son is dragged through a high-school level class where this vomit is spewed under the guise of ‘teaching alternative theories’. It’s not a goddamn theory. Stop it.
- People who claim evolution is false because it doesn’t cover what happened before the big bang or how life was started. News flash- SEPARATE THEORIES. Evolution makes no claim about that sorta thing.
- People who claim evolution shouldn’t be taught because it’s ‘just a theory’. Yes, much like [gravity, atomic theory, game theory, string theory, etc.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_theories) are all theories as well, should we not teach them? Either way…You FAIL.
- People who claim a banana is proof of intelligent design, while turning a blind eye to coconuts, poisonous berries, pineapple and of course the [Durian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durian). These are all either delicious or will kill you. Does that seem like a good idea? Ever see the delicious red berries of Belladonna, aka Deadly Nightshade? You FAIL.
- People who think the world is flat- seriously, there are people who [think the world is fucking flat](http://forums.fark.com/cgi/fark/comments.pl?IDLink=3780058). It boggles the mind. This has to be some sort of sick joke- are we really still this backwards?
- In no particular order- people who deny global warming because winters are getting nastier, people who [deny gravity is strong enough to cause stellar formation](http://angryastronomer.blogspot.com/2007/01/on-stellar-formation.html#4281919650068309489) without having ANY science to back it up, people who think “controversy” should be taught in science by allowing bullshit into the classroom, people with political agendas who [claim to know more about science than the experts in the field](http://rationalwiki.com/wiki/Lenski_affair), people against stem cell research, People who buy into crop circles despite the original perpetrators admitting they did it for 15 years, etc

Before you try and argue this shit with me, go read [The Demon-Haunted World](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0345409469/103-5816323-3497432?ie=UTF8&tag=literescap-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=1789&creativeASIN=0345409469) by Carl Sagan. It’s very readable, if not slightly depressing.

I’ve had some great science teachers in my life – my father and Mr. Mac being at the top of the list. I remember watching Nova and Newton’s Apple when I was a kid, specifically an experiment where they created a tornado in a box. I remember thinking how cool that was. I never forgot that clip, and whenever I think of science, it reminds me of that fuzzy memory from the early-to-mid 80’s. I can only hope I can inspire that interest in science for Ian as he grows up.

Now, I’m all for imagination and testing new hypothesis, but you DAMN sure better have some heavy science behind you before making that claim. It’s absolutely unreal that this shit is still going on. They’re not attacking just the ideas or the theories- I’d be fine if it was just that.

- Got an alternate theory for String theory? Go for it.
- More accurate equation to calculate gravitational forces? FINE.

Show me the math and wow me. More importantly, wow the people who are experts in the field. I’d love to see someone put out a theory that makes Hawkings say (in a robotic accent) “holy shit, why didn’t I think of that.” Just don’t attack science itself. Don’t attack Scientific Theory, the method for understanding our world. Don’t crap on how we try to understand our world unless you have a better way, and throwing your hands up in the air and saying “God did it!” doesn’t count. It doesn’t even come close.

At one time people thought a flaming chariot dragged the sun across the sky – seems silly now, doesn’t it. At one time, they thought the sun rotated around the earth – crazy talk now, huh? Hell, people even used to think the world is flat, but we know better…Oh right, we still don’t.

If you disagree with this rant in part or in whole, read the Sagan book, and follow the astronomy bloggers I mentioned above. Pay attention for one month. Then we’ll talk.

**Update:**  
I also missed the [AntiVaxxers](http://rationalwiki.com/wiki/Vaccine_hysteria)– that group of wonderful people who pin an epic woe on a vaccine and encourage people not to get it. Thanks to this, there are people dying and suffering from easily treatable diseases, like polio- POLIO for crying out loud. Hey- the 1950’s called, they say they want their eradicated epidemic back.
