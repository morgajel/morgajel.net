So there we was- Garrik, Usa, Tree, and all all here dead minions. I got the Wrath of Ares in hand and the call of battle in my mind. Everything is red.

I charge and roar.
Initiative 25



I roar and push through the barrier. (Intimidate 32)
My invisibility holds
Half of the line flees in terror

half sword and shield, half spears
some halberds
all but one crossbowmen run.


one officer

the Left line breaks and flees, including the officer.

Of the 20 soldiers, 13 fled.

Round 1:

Only 2 remain on the left side- an officer and a cleric. I rush the officer and land 3 blows (actionsurge) before he knows what happened, crumpling him (49+50+48dmg)
then turing to the cleric and grin before obliterating him (50 + 52dmg).

Tree''s minions move the barricade and surge forth.
