So what else can our [locationGenerator](http://morgajel.net/2013/02/02/1313 "Hey, what’s that? Part 1: The Ruins") describe? How about an object. A simple object is something that you could pick up and take with you. Perhaps as small as a glowing grain of sand on a dark deserted Highway, or as large as broken cart.

So, what kind of objects are you likely to find? perhaps something mundane or magical, common or creepy. A toy, instrument, book, tool? What about a cheese wheel or loaf of moldy bread? A weapon, armor, or simply dung. Whats it’s condition, and who was a likely owner? was it stolen? hidden or otherwise packaged? Is someone missing it or looking for it, or was it tossed because it was broken, or even cursed. Is the object intrinsically valuable, or worthless. Does it show signs of wear? what color and texture is it?

> During your travels, you stumble across a \[new/old/pristine/worn/damaged\] \[book\] \[hidden/visible\] \[along the side of the road/off the beaten path/in the middle of the road\]. Something about the book makes you feel \[disturbed/estatic/cautious/amused\]. The \[book\] looks vaguely \[elvish/orcish/human\], and the wear suggests it \[has/hasn’t\] \[been here a while/had many owners\]. A design is on the cover showing a dragon eating a mushroom and is written in a \[familiar/unfamiliar\] \[script/language\]. Browsing through it, it appears to be a \[history\] book. The \[book\] appears incredibly valuable. You have no idea why this object was left here; perhaps it was \[left behind by a thief/accidentally dropped/purposefully dropped/dropped in a panic/cursed\].

> During your travels you stumble across a\[n axe/ sword/ mace\] on the road. Something about the weapon leads you to think it’s \[seen too many battles.\] The weapon appears \[pristine/rusted/worn/well maintained\] and \[well crafted/poorly crafted\].

> During your travels, you stumble across a worn bag in the middle of the road. Inside you find a damaged book…

And this one will require a lot of variation for each type of object.
