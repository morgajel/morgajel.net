One of my side projects this past year was developing a “Radio Show” program to track and display info about songs currently playing on my stream. I’ve taken the last few months off, but now I’m back on track.

Unfortunately the stream is not available to the public (You can thank the RIAA for that bit of bullshit).

If you have any comments, feel free to add them to my bugtracker: <http://morgajel.com/mantis/>

I gotta patch up a few bugs, rework how schedules are handled then optimize the actual radio.pl file. Interesting side note here- I was right about load- once the system gets a certain number of entries, it becomes bogged down under it’s own weight. I’m gonna have to heavily optimize some of my sql queries to get this ready for a production environment.

Once that’s done, I’ll open it up and offer it up for licensing.
