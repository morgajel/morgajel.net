Midi- oh, how do I loathe thee? Let me count the ways‚Ä¶

I‚Äôve never liked midi, it‚Äôs fabricated, boring, hollow existence bothers me whenever I hear it, yet I am currently at it‚Äôs mercy. Linux may be ahead of other operating systems in many respects, but for some reason, midi support seems to have been completely passed over.

One of my side projects right now is writing a CD. a useful tool for writing a CD is a Piano. Since I do not own/have room for a piano, I decided to purchase a midi controller to attach to my computer. After careful research, went down to Guitar Center and picked up the second cheapest one I could find- the M-Audio Oxygen. It only has 25 keys, but I figure, hey I only got 10 digits. Even if I was to get my toes into the act, I‚Äôd have 5 keys to spare!

So anyways, I honestly have been planning on getting one for almost a year. I got it home and found the joy of trying to get it to work with Linux. Since my onboard soundcard was a piece of crap, I had problems getting midi to work in general. I got fed up and went and spent ANOTHER $80 to pick up a new sound card- another purchase i‚Äôve been planning on. I got an Creative Soundblaster Audigy 4, which I was told had reasonable recording capabilities, hardware midi sequencer and reasonable linux support‚Ä¶

‚ÄúReasonable‚Äù is a funny word- it‚Äôs completely subjective. If a dung beetle came up and offered you a plate and said ‚Äúhey man, eat up, this is good shit,‚Äù You‚Äôd probably realize he meant well, but still decline the plate full of feces. Taste, much like beauty, is in the eye of the beholder. So back to my reasonable support. After a bit of battling, I was able to get regular playback working- as an added bonus, I can now turn down the bass on my subwoofer so the neighbors don‚Äôt hate me. Midi, however, is still out of my grasp.

‚ÄúThey‚Äù were partially right. There‚Äôs lots of documentation. on all the various versions of the audigy (except of course mine), on different distributions, some using alsa, some using oss, finding different problems, using different versions of everything. No one person has anything remotely close to my setup from what I can tell- Audigy 4 + Gentoo + M-Audio Oxygen midi controller + ALSA. In other words, hundreds of pages of crap to sort through and very little of it useful by itself. I don‚Äôt blame the linux community for this, I blame the lazy manufacturers who refuse to help and make us end up doing it for them. It sucks and it pisses me off.

So anyways, I have three goals-

1. get midi playback working, so I can listen to ff2.mid
2. get my keyboard working so can input into the program called ‚Äúnoteedit‚Äù
3. figure out what part, if any, this remote and IR tower have in this.

### Getting Midi to Work 

Here‚Äôs an idea of where I‚Äôm at now.

I‚Äôve used afxload to load my sf2 soundbank. I believe this has worked correctly.

I can open kmid and play ff2.mid, but no sound comes out. the little virtual keyboards flicker and play, but no sound. I‚Äôve doublechecked and the ‚Äúsynth‚Äù slider in kmix/alsamixer/etc is at full volume.

### Getting the midi Keyboard to Work

I figure this can wait till we get the rest of midi working, but I‚Äôve found when it‚Äôs hooked up via usb, /dev/midi and /dev/midi00 will both output characters when catted and the keyboard is pressed. This means usb-linux is working, but it‚Äôs still not recognized by alsa. I believe I also have to load some type of firmware into it, but I‚Äôm a little fuzzy on that part.

```

draccus ~ # cat /dev/midi
√É∆í√Ç¬æ√É∆í√Ç¬æ√É∆í√Ç¬æ√É∆í√Ç¬æ√É∆í√Ç¬æ√É∆í√Ç¬æ√É∆í√Ç¬æ√É∆í√Ç¬æ;2;;B;;B;;?
```

###  IR Tower and Remote

The soundcard came with a remote and USB IR tower. the remote is a Creative RM-1500.  
One of the posts on this page about [ALSA, audigy and emu10k1](http://www.alsa-project.org/alsa-doc/doc-php/template.php?company=Creative+Labs&card=Sound+Blaster+Audigy+ES.&chip=emu10k2&module=emu10k1) seemed to imply midi wouldn‚Äôt work until the IR tower was fixed. Check out the ‚Äù Sunday, 29 February 2004‚Ä≥ post for more info.

If anyone has any questions/comments/help/ explicit directions, I‚Äôd be very greatful. I just checked my history in firefox and I have over 100 articles that I‚Äôve read and 34 google searches. I‚Äôm running out of steam.

BTW, big thanks to the guys of #alsa and K\_F for helping me get as far as I got- if I seem frustrated, it‚Äôs because I am üôÇ

## Update 1

Alright, so after letting my subconcious work on the problem last night, I‚Äôve come up with a plan of attack. what‚Äôs really hurting me on this is a lack of knowledge revolving around my hardware and alsa, so I‚Äôm going to do a bit of reading up about alsa today. I‚Äôve come up with the following troubleshooting goals:

Identify a path that I can troubleshoot- how can I make sure asfxload is working? How can I verify Synth volume is up? what comes next? what needs to be there?

I should note that Timidity is up and running, and I can use it to verify that yes, synth volume is reasonable.

I guess the next step is to verify that soundfonts are being loaded.
