Well, the new job is gonna have a bucket full of FreeBSD servers. It’s been a while since I tinkered with FBSD, so it’ll be a challenge. To prepare for that challenge, I’ve decided to convert Draccus (my workstation) to BSD. The following is a list of hurdles I’ll need to surpass before I start in April:

- get draccus up and running
- get KDE up and running
- get Gimp working
- get my Wacom Graphire 3 tablet working
- get my Logitech Quickcam working
- get my m-audio keyboard working
- get rosegarden recording again
- burn a cd-rw
- burn a dvd+rw

I’m presuming I’ll have no problems with my Nvidia 6600 GT, Audigy 4 soundcard, or other common hardware. With the problems I’ve been having with linux as of late (specifically draccus) there is a moderate chance I might fully convert from Linux to BSD. If I can accomplish the above list, I will continue using FBSD for one year. The disc is burning now.
