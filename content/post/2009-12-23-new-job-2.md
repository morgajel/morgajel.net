So I recently accepted a new job as many people have heard. While I gave 2 weeks notice, due to my access my manager was kind enough to walk me out that day (thanks mick).

This means I’ll get paid for the next 2 weeks per my notice without actually having to work. I just want to be clear that this is \*AWESOME\*, not rude or lame.

New job will be as a Linux/Tomcat administrator. sure, my drive jumped from 15 minutes to 25 minutes, but it’s worth it for a number of reasons:

- Pay bump
- More Tech focused (EPI was moving me to a more paper-pusher type role)
- Open Source Focused (EPI was moving away from Opensource in an effort to cut costs by replacing a well known free opensource technology with a relatively unknown proprietary technology that will cost a small fortune. It’s ok tho, i’m sure there’s no [ difference](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=endeca%20hybris%20resume) in the [ talent pool](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=redhat%20jboss%20resume).)

Anyways, yesterday was my first day on the new job and so far it’s going good- I set up apache, mysql, openldap, phpldapadmin, mediawiki, svn, webdav and some self-signed certs. It was a good first day, and I have a good feeling about the job and the team. Alright, off to work.
