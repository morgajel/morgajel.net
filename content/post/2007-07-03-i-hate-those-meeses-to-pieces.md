So some time in the middle of the night, I’m awoken by this strange, high pitch squeaking sound- almost a whistle. I could hear movement in the other room, so I figured it was the cats playing with a toy.In Truth, the cats have ADD and usually stop after about 10 seconds or so, but this kept going… 20.. 30 seconds. I finally got up and walked into the other room to see chaos playing with a live mouse. It was a tiny little thing, maybe three inches from nose to tail, and she was batting it back and forth up and down the hallway.

She knocked it into the kitchen, and I followed to grab a jar or something to put over it so I could scoop it up and put it outside (far far away). By the time I had something, Chaos had knocked it under the fridge. Try as I might, I could not lift the fridge, full of food, in the middle of the night to scoop him out, so I waited until morning and Jackie called maintenance to get some traps. They set up two traps- one under the stove and one behind the fridge.

In the middle of the day, Jackie messages me saying she heard a trap go off- I come home that night to find one squished little mouse under the stove. I toss mouse and trap and think nothing of it- problem solved (except chaos, who was heartbroken). This should be the end of the story.

This morning I wake up and walk into the kitchen and, out of the corner of my eye, see the trap behind the fridge is upside down. As I walk over for a closer inspection, I see not one, but TWO mice sticking out of the trap.

So apparently we have mice. I’m gonna need more traps.
