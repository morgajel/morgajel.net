Lets look at the third type of location generation: the Sculpture.

What type of sculpture is it, a statue? relief carving? stone, wood, metal? lifelike or abstract? is the artist unknown, minor or famous? how big is it? how do the locals feel about it? what is the lore related to it? Does it have any type of power?

> During your travels, you stumble across a \[small/medium/large\] \[stone/granite/wood/oak\] \[carving//engraving/statue\] of a \[creature/human/elf/orc/man\]. The details were carved with a \[measured/experienced/crude\] hand. You’d estimate that is is potentially \[days/weeks/years/decades/centuries\] old from the wear and weathering and appears to be in \[excellent/average/poor\] condition.

It appears to have been created by a\[n unknown/renown/famous\] artist named \[name\] who is \[native/foreign\] to the region. It is said to represent \[bullshit artsy stuff\].

> Locals are \[aware of/familiar with/unfamiliar with/oblivious of\] the sculpture, however those who see it view it with \[distrust/trepidation/reverence\].Local lore says this area was used for \[sacrifices/prayers\], of which the sculpture played \[no/a major/a minor\] role. Some even say that the statue \[contains/lacks\] power over \[the weather/crops/evil\] often attributed to it.
