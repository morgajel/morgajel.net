I recently emailed my representatives letting them know that I think [SOPA is a horrible piece of legislation](http://www.literaryescapism.com/25073/why-you-should-care-about-sopa) and asked them where they stood on the issue. This is the response I received from Debbie Stabenow:

This legislation would penalize Internet sites that engage in the unlawful sharing or sale of counterfeit goods or services, which range from new movie and music releases, to pharmaceuticals and consumer products. I will keep your position on this bill in mind as it moves through the legislative process.
