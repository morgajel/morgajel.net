So Iâ€™ve started teaching guitar again- This time the cash will go directly towards the G-400. As you can see on the sidebar, Iâ€™m now a hair closer. My new student is a coworker who is very excited to learn, so that makes things easy on several fronts (schedules, payment, attendance, etc). At this rate, I should have the guitar by next fall- sooner if I pick up another student (which is a possibility).

that said, Iâ€™m still accepting donations ðŸ˜€
