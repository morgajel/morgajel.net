My friend [k\_f](http://www.kfwebs.net/) sent me a link containing the [ resignation of the debian stable maintainer](http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2006/03/msg00008.html). I can completely see where he’s coming from- the Debian crowd seems to have collected all of the antisocial jerks over the years. I sent him the following letter of support:

> Hi there, I caught your post to the debian team’s mailing list from a friend (http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2006/03/msg00008.html ).
> 
> As a former debian user, I wanted to let you know I fully support you. There is a large segement of the debian crowd that has their heads firmly up their asses. It’s not often that someone from the inside calls them on it.
> 
> My experience with “debian snobbery” was with some kde ugliness in the migration to kde 3.x from kde 2.x. I found a problem with one of the dependencies on a package, and when I asked someone to verify it, I was bluntly told “debian doesn’t have dependency problems.” I was then berated by mwilson for 20 minutes before I said screw you all and downloaded a Gentoo ISO. I’ve been using Gentoo for almost 3 years now, and I gotta tell you it’s one of the best moves I’ve made.
> 
> The debian community as a whole is aloof, snobby, and generally unhelpful and rude. I’d suggest finding another distro- I’m sure ubuntu or mepis would gladly accept you- heck, even the gentoo guys would, although I suspect there’d be a bit of a learning curve for you.
> 
> You’re gonna get a lot of shit over the next few days, and I figured a positive email would help. Release your hate, your hubris, your ego, and snobbery, (however small they may be), and find a new distro to work with. The community as a whole needs you, even if those ungrateful asshats don’t realize it. Give them a good shake on the way out.
