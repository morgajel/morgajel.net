So what else can our [locationGenerator](http://morgajel.net/2013/02/02/1313 "Hey, what’s that? Part 1: The Ruins") describe? How about some odd vegetation.

How can vegetation be odd? Perhaps its a dead zone? Scorched from a dragon? locusts have ruined it? A drought? Perhaps it’s unusually sized? Does it look healthy or sickly? Is there a creature that has contaminated it, made it better, or is dependent on it? are there corpses nearby?

Is it grasslands? a clutch of trees? an orchard or field? is it wild and over grown or cultivated?

Is there signs of magical or natural contamination? Does it serve some cultural or natural importance to this region? is it harvest time? Are druids or rangers involved?

Is anyone upset by the current status of the vegetation? is anyone currently eating it?
