So I think I need to actually keep track of the Wii games I like so I don’t lose track of them. Here’s what I recall being worth buying, what I am anticipating, and what were good purchases.

- Mario Kart Wii (bought)
- Excite Truck (bought)
- Mario Galaxy
- Mario Strikers Charged
- Warioware: Smooth Moves
- PuzzleQuest
- Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess
- Metroid Prime: Corruption
- Spore (?)

More to come as I think of them. Any suggestions?
