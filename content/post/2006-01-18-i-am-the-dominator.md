so I created a list of things I needed to do, and started incrementally going through it, finishing little projects and problems that I’ve been meaning to get to. I’ve got a whole lot done in the past week:

- got squirrelmail working properly
- fixed the DMA on both workstations
- Fixed Jaxon’s cdrom
- Set up Kmail
- Fixed the DNS issues
- Swapped HDs around
- get spanish dictionary working for jackie in OOo
- Set up LDAP

Some of these have been floating in my head for years (ldap) while others have been broken for just as long (DMA, squirrelmail). It feels good to accompish something, no matter how trivial.
