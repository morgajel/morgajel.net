Ok, Iâ€™ve done it twice now, I think Iâ€™ve figured it out.  
Get the source files from Epsonâ€™s linux website; I donâ€™t recall the url but these are the files you need (or newer, no idea what the future holds):

```

iscan-2.3.0-1.c2.i386.rpm
iscan-plugin-gt-f700-2.0.0-0.c2.i386.rpm  
```

Use alien to convert them to debs (normally bad, but acceptable this time around).

Install both newly created deb packages with dpkg:  
`dpkg -i iscan_2.3.0-2_i386.deb iscan-plugin-gt-f700_2.0.0-1_i386.deb`  
Install sane, sane-utils:  
`<br></br>apt-get install sane sane-utils<br></br>`

Edit /etc/sane.d/dll.conf, replacing epson with epkowa (yes, Iâ€™m serious).

add the following to /etc/udev/rules.d/45-libsane.rules:  
`<br></br># Epson Perfection v350<br></br>SYSFS{idVendor}=="04b8", SYSFS{idProduct}=="012f", MODE="664", GROUP="scanner"<br></br>`

And I think thatâ€™s about it. Make sure youâ€™re in the scanner group, and run:  
`<br></br>scanimage -L<br></br>`

That should simply list your scanner- if it doesnâ€™t let me know- I might have missed something. From this point on you should be able to access the scanner with either sane or iscan.

The one downside to this driver is it doesnâ€™t do the full 48000 PSI, only 24000- this means a scan of a guitar pick is \*only\* 16 inches across, rather than 32 inches ðŸ™‚ Unfortuantely itâ€™s not the preferred resolution for negatives.
