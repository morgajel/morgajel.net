So AT&amp;T managed to screw me yet one more time. The “loop link” is damaged, so the best Cyberonic can provide is 3meg/768 rather than the 6meg/768 that I should be getting.

If I’m lucky, the problem with be with the illegally run line through my neighbor’s yard. If I’m unlucky, it’s a damaged like 1/4 mile away and completely unfixable. I plan on calling the proper people about the illegal line and having them re-run it. with any luck, maybe that’ll fix it. If not… oh well, I guess 3 meg will work. Shame it costs so much.

I really hate AT&amp;T.
