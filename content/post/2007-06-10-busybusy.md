So I just realized that Iâ€™ve become uber busy as of late. My current side projects look like this:  
â€“ Warhammer Army builder for ChrisP written in Ruby (on Rails)  
â€“ reviving radio.morgajel.com and rebuilding my stream (RoR, again)  
â€“ SecretWord module and Logging for Ziggy (Perl + Po::Co::IRC)  
â€“ ImportLDIF plugin for Luma

This isnâ€™t including the miniature painting, work, or Ian. The weird part is it feels nice to be busy- but only when itâ€™s busy on my terms ðŸ™‚
