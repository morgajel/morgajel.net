ok, I’m gonna start doing reviews for the games I rent for the Wii- the ratings will go something like this:

First Tier Buy: Great game, you should absolutely buy it  
Second Tier Buy: Decent- not the best, but still fun.  
Third Tier Buy: If you’ve run out of things to try, give it a shot.  
Don’t Bother: I won’t even recommend renting it.
