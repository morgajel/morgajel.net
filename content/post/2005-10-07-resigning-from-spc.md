Yesterday I turned in my resignation. October 21st will be my last day. I was offered a job at another place, a big Gov’t contractor in the US as the Lead Linux Systems Administrator. The pay is better and the work sounds more fun. Just wanted to share that with you.

Perhaps later down the road I’ll release my reasons for actually leaving- you know, the dirty secrets that disgusted me to the point of find another job. not that it will be libelous or untrue or proprietary in any way.

update:  
upon sage advice, I’ve removed the names of both companies to protect myself from morons. this will also give me free reign to talk shit about them.
