With the freakout of my raid array and the rebuilding of my server, it’s about that time of year where I re-rip all of my audio CDs. Since I don’t think mp3c was ever updated since the last rip (and subsequent mangling of a few titles), I’ll be investigating some of these new rippers:

burn – Command line Data-CD, Audio-CD, ISO-CD, Copy-CD writing tool  
crip – terminal-based ripper/encoder/tagger tool  
cwcdr – Chez Wam CD Ripper  
digitaldj – An SQL based mp3 player front-end  
dir2ogg – audio file converter into ogg-vorbis format  
distmp3 – A Perl client and daemon for distributed audio encoding  
grabcd-encode – rip and encode audio CDs – encoder  
grip – GNOME-based CD-player/ripper/encoder  
i810switch – Enables/disables video output to CRT/LCD on i810 video hardware  
jack – Rip and encode CDs with one command  
mp3burn – burn audio CDs directly from MP3, Ogg Vorbis, or FLAC files  
mp3c – MP3Creator – Creator for MP3/OGG-files  
mp3cd – Burns normalized audio CDs from lists of MP3s/WAVs/Oggs/FLACs  
mybashburn – Burn data and create songs with interactive dialog box  
ripit – Textbased audio cd ripper  
ripperx – a GTK-based audio CD ripper/encoder  
kaudiocreator – CD ripper and audio encoder frontend for KDE  
mozilla-plugin-vlc – multimedia plugin for web browsers based on VLC

more details to come as I dig into it.
