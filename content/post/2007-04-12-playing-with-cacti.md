So I’m looking to play with some monitoring software to figure out why, every once in a while, I get laggy spots when connecting to my server from work.

The latest toy I’m playing with is [Cacti](http://cacti.net/).

Here’s what I’m planning on monitoring (partially because it’s useful, partially because it’s fun):

link (Linksys router running dd-wrt)  
\* bandwidth on external IP  
\* bandwidth on each port  
\* wireless bandwidth used  
\* memory used  
\* processor used  
\* uptime

Unicron (server)  
\* bandwidth used  
\* memory used  
\* processor used  
\* load avg  
\* spam stats  
\* apache trafic  
\* IRC users  
\* ssh users  
\* bind traffic  
\* uptime

Draccus (server)  
\* bandwidth used  
\* memory used  
\* load avg  
\* processor used  
\* ssh users  
\* uptime

Any other suggestions on what to monitor, or which templates to use?
