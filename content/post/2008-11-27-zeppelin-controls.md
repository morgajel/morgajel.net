In *The Autobiography of Ziggy Swift*, Ziggy gets the opportunity to fly a Gnomish Zeppelin. In order to get my head into one of the scenes, I’m trying to envision what controls would be at his disposal. Here’s the list so far… any additions?

- move forward
- move backwards
- move up
- move down
- turn left
- turn right
- landing gears
- elevator music selector
- running lights
- landing lights
- take off lights
- head lights
- tail lights
- blimp lights- ones that are on top of the blimp
- windshield wipers
- camel lights – in case you’re transporting a camel
- water pump
- emergency cargo dump
- ejection seat
- rejection seat (like an ejection seat except it throws you straight into the ground with no parachute)
- emergency break
- anchor up/down
- fire suppression system
- gas suppression system
- Kobold suppression system
- theft deterrent – press the button and it launches a rock in your face
- Anti-turtle system
- Bottle opener
- Zombie detection
- window heat shields
- Thermometer
- Altimeter
- Speedometer
- Wind speed
- Wind direction
- Moon phase tracker
- hand warmers
- shields- two bucklers that can be “raised” on the front of the ship
