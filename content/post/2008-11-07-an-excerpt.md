> Kibbel clamped his hands over his eyes and trembled. In the distance the wagon creaked and groaned as the off-kilter hoofbeats of the single horse plodded forward at full speed. Slowly, the creaking and groaning grew louder.
> 
> “OH GOD IT’S COMING RIGHT FOR US! RUUUUUUNNNNN!!!” I screamed and pushed Kibbel. He screamed as well and ran north as fast as his legs could carry him. I ran behind him a bit and gave my best impression of a dragon roar, causing him to scream and run faster. I stopped, but he didn’t. He continued to run, tripping and falling several times, but never uncovering his face. After 30 minutes of running, he faded out of site over a hill. After chasing him off, I stood in the middle of theroad and waited for Haynar’s wagon.
> 
> Haynar still looked confused when he pulled up. “Was that the ogre? What did you do to get him to run like that?”
> 
> “I told him you had an invisible Steel dragon that could turn him to stone if he saw it, and told him to run when it flew back through.” I explained triumphantly.
> 
> “Wait, Invisible dragon that turned you to stone when you saw it? But… ok, well what was the he quicksilver for?” he asked, momentarily confused, then growing impressed.
> 
> I held up the steel ball and wiped a finger across it, displaying a coat of quicksilver. “How do you prove an invisible steel dragon exists… Have you ever had a bird poop on you?”
> 
> “No but-” his eyes narrowed with understanding, “Oh no… and he bought it?”
> 
> I smiled, examining the quicksilver on my finger, and gave it a taste (It sorta tasted like one of those copper coins Semus kept in his sock). “What can I say, Ogres are dumb.”
