So for whatever reason, I was googling around today and stumbled across [this](http://nostapoelagua.blogspot.com/2006/08/programa-n-22-05082006-descarga.html) and saw that, damnit, someone stole my monkey. Not only that, but theyâ€™re linking directly to my server, and have been since 2006. I google more, and find [someone using my security monkey to demonstrate an XSS attack](http://underhack.foroes.net/t22-publica-aqui-tus-defaces).

Now, the reason I created this image was for [my security monkey shirt](http://www.cafepress.com/morgajel.430744907#).

I ask that everyone show their solidarity by spreading the work of the security monkey shirt to people most likely to buy one.
