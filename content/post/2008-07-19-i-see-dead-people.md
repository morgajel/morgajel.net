<span style="color:blue">(02:30:37 PM) DeveloperY:</span> man i‚Äôm still trying to figure out who that dev is  
<span style="color:red">(02:31:04 PM) me:</span> that developer is a good guy, but he does dimwitted things now and again  
<span style="color:blue">(02:31:41 PM) DeveloperY:</span> hmmm

<span style="color:blue">(02:33:58 PM) DeveloperY:</span> i only have 2 candidates left  
<span style="color:red">(02:35:41 PM) me:</span> his application passes plaintext usernames and passwords via get strings  
<span style="color:blue">(02:36:07 PM) DeveloperY:</span> hmmmmm must be outside consumer  
<span style="color:blue">(02:36:39 PM) DeveloperY:</span> idk who it is but i really wanna give them a good kicking in the ass up and down the hall  
<span style="color:red">(02:37:03 PM) me:</span> on \*many\* occasions, I‚Äôve had to help debug their code because they couldn‚Äôt see what was wrong.  
<span style="color:blue">(02:37:09 PM) DeveloperY:</span> omfg  
<span style="color:blue">(02:37:33 PM) DeveloperY:</span> i‚Äôm in the first stage, denial

<span style="color:red">(02:43:30 PM) me:</span> this developer didn‚Äôt know svn creates a .svn directory when you check something out, so doing an rm -rf \* won‚Äôt ‚Äúunlink‚Äù a directory from a repository.

<span style="color:blue">(02:46:23 PM) DeveloperY:</span> to this degree i can only put DeveloperE &amp; DeveloperF  
<span style="color:blue">(02:46:30 PM) DeveloperY:</span> there maybe others but idk them
