So Iâ€™ve been working with QtRuby a lot the last few days. Iâ€™ve also been playing with unit testing thanks to [drutroâ€™s](http://morgajel.com/images/drutro.jpg) quick runthrough of it. The project Iâ€™m working on is a top-down view videogame, which at itâ€™s base level requires loading up some images. The problem is using Qt::Pixmap requires that a QApplication exists. Now this in and of itself is annoying, but not a showstopper.

What becomes a showstopper is building a test suite when each test file has itâ€™s own QApplication- you see, you can only have one QApplication at a time. So I thought â€œwell, Iâ€™ll just build and destory the QApplication in the setup and teardown functions of the Unit Tests- then I found out that [oh you canâ€™t destroy a QApplication](http://lists.kde.org/?l=pykde&m=114658756411698&w=3). They stick around and itâ€™s like you never removed it. So I tried the Qt-4 ruby bindings and got the same result.

At this point I was getting damn frustrated. You couldnâ€™t just put the QApplication in the suite or the test wonâ€™t work. you canâ€™t put the QApplication in the tests or the suite wonâ€™t workâ€¦ Then it occured to me that perhaps I should do both- so I found A LEGITIMATE USE FOR GLOBAL VARIABLES:

```

if ( ! defined?($qApp) )
    # Qt needs an application object to exist before loading a pixmap.
    $qApp = Qt::Application.new(ARGV)
end
```

I put that in the bottom of each test and in the suite as well and now itâ€™s all happy. I hope people find this reference on google if theyâ€™re trying to do unit testing with QtRuby and find this problem. You can thank me by sending lots of money to paypal@ this domain ðŸ™‚

**Update**  
after talking with rdale, it turns out that qtruby has a variable set aside for this called $qApp- Iâ€™ve changed the variable above to reflect this.
