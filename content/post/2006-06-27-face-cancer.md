I’ve had this freckle on my right cheek for as long as I can remember. I’ve never really been fond of it, and I guess the freckle took it personally. Last week it started to itch, then swell, then get real sore… then started changing color. At first I thought it was just an ingrown hair or something relatively normal. I told jackie to set up an appointment with the doctor so I could have it looked at.

Then, friday while I was sitting at work, then I rubbed it… and a chunk of flesh came off. It wasn’t really a scab because it was still soft, but reminded me of one.

Then came the bleeding. it bled for a good 15 minutes. I went home, had it bleed the next day, and bleed a whole lot when I took a shower and the scabbing got wet. It had stopped bleeding (mostly) by sunday.

Monday I had the appointment- it was sorta cool. the doctor stabbed me in the face with a needle, and proceeded to hack off part of my cheek for a biopsy. when he was done, he used this cool cautrizer that uses and electric arc to fry the flesh. I was just sitting there completely aware that he was electrocuting my face (my jaw and ear were twinging) and I could smell burnt flesh. Now I have a scar on my face and will find out the biopsy report next week.

While it’s fun to say “Face Cancer,” truth be told I’d rather not have it.
