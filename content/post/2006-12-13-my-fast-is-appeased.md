So we got in a fender bender last week and had to put the car in the shop- Insurance got us a rental for a few days while it was in. Fortunately, the rental place was all out of cars in my range, so I had to drive a 2006 Dodge Charger.

It Goes Fast.

Sadly, it also gets 24mpg if you drive like a granny, so you can’t drive it fast or you’ll actually see the gas gauge drop. Anyways, I just gave it back to Jackie to return now that the Corolla is out of the shop. It was fun while it lasted, but the Corolla is honestly more fun to drive and has way more pickup.
