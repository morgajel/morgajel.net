I go through these obsessive cycles where I’l focus on one thing and ride it out for a few months, forgetting about everything else.

Since I started talking to Mr. Bojangles about guitar lessons, I’ve been playing nonstop.  
My calluses are up to 80% already (after being at 2% for over a year) and I’ve been looking for all sorts of teaching resources. I’ve found some great tools that will help me improve and allow me to help others get better. Now the question is “how long will it last?”

My record is about 5 months. If Ed doesn’t give up on lessons, it could go longer.
