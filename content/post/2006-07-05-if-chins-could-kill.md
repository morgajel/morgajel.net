Bruce campbell is sort of a hero of mine- he seems like a nice guy, he’s very charismatic, and plays a lot of roles that I find memorable (which include Evil Dead 1 and 2, army of darkness, Brisco County Jr, and a hundred other bitparts). I got his book for christmas a while back and never got around to reading it- actually, I only read it after a friend borrowed it and said the beginning was ok, but it got boring in the middle.

I started reading this book sunday afternoon, then read it all of monday to the point of being up until 8am tuesday. I was drawn into it and couldn’t put it down, which doesn’t happen often.

He’s a witty writer, has a lot of good stories to tell. If you’re a fan of Army of Darkness or Brisco County Jr, give it a read. Very good stuff.
