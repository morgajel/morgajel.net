So I had my first head-butting with Redhat Enterprise today.  
I thought I’d give it the run through, try to do things the RH way while building my command center. Since Dell gives away Advanced Server disc packs like candy, there were a few laying around.

Went through the trouble of installing RHEL AS v3 only to find out that it not only doesn’t come with yum, but to register properly with their up2date network, it’ll cost $1500. Yes, $1500 to update this newly installed RH box.

Holy crap. I only have one thing to say to that….

I have 34 minutes before the debian netinstall disc finished downloading.
