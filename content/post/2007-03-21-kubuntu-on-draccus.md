This was one of the articles I never posted for whatever reason…

So I’m switching over to Kubuntu on my main workstation. The following is a list of things I had to tweak to get kubuntu working as I wanted as well as a rage meter displaying how annoying it was to configure.

| Project | Rage level | Time Wasted |
|---|---|---|
| ldap auth | frothing mouth | 1.5 hours |
| nfs mounts | minor annoyance | 5 minutes |
| nvidia driver | n/a | 1 minute |
| wacom | n/a | 1 minute |

Unfortunately I don’t remember what else I changed on it, so overall this is much less than there should be.
