I finally got around to [modifying the sa-stats script](http://morgajel.com/sa-stats.txt) k\_f gave me- it now works on my setup of postfix+gentoo+spamd.

I unzipped, cat’ed and parsed my logs for the last 7 days and came up with the following stats:

```

Total messages:      Ham:       Spam:      % Spam:
--------------------------------------------------
572                  196        376        65.73%

Average spam score  : 20.04/6.00
Average ham score   : -9.04/6.00

Username:            Total:     Ham:       Spam:      % Spam:
------------------------------------------------------------
                     572        196        376        65.73%

Username:            Avg. ham score:      Avg. spam score:
------------------------------------------------------------
                     -9.04/6.00           20.04/6.00
```

I knew I recieved a lot of spam, but this is stupid. I buy stuff online, but I purposfully avoid buying anything mentioned in spam. Spam doesn’t work on me- in fact, it has the opposite effect- I ignore their products. Now some spam, from buy.com, ticketmaster or whatever, I understand because they I’ve bought from them before. Their emails are annoying, but I know for a fact that they haven’t sold my email address (I use buy.com as my username for my email address at morgajel.com and it automagically gets back to me.)

I’m annoyed, but I can understand it. It’s not caught by my filter. The stuff that IS caught? Utter crap. 65% of my incoming mail is utter crap. Like someone found a way to digitize horse shit and place it in my inbox.

These people are annoying; they’re scum of the earth. What they do serves no purpose other than greed. What we need is public lynching of spammers. I hate that there are people in the world who don’t get that this is pure bullshit; and worse is that the spammers **defend** what they’re doing- they think it’s legitimate! They honestly believe that. It makes me lose more faith in humanity.

Before I finish up, I’d just like to pass a word to the spammers that are listening- I’m not going to purchase OEM software. I don’t care how good of a deal you have on it, it just ain’t gonna happen. Quit trying to sell me XP, it’s a lost cause.

ok, rant over.
