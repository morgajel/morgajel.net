Had another weird dream. There was more to the dream, but the last 30 seconds of it overshadowed the rest. some parts were spilled along a highway and jackie and I were cleaning them up (was a large project, 20 other people doing this too) and I decide to grab onto the back of the car while jackie drives to the next part.

But she doesn’t slow down. She keeps going faster and faster, thinking it’s funny, and I start yelling at her to slow down. at this point she’s doing 60 mph. I just hear her giggling. The next thing I know I’m clutching onto the sides of the roof of the car screaming at her to slow down, my chest pounding, and she’s doing 127 mph and I’m starting to slip off. I know I’m about to die.

I wake up with my chest pounding at 6:05 am. My chest actually hurts, and it’s hard to breath, but I’m wide awake and sit up. I’ve had dreams like this before, and I’m convinced this is how I’m going to die- I’ll be 60 years old and have a vivid dream and have a heart-attack.
