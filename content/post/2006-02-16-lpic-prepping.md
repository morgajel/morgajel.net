I’ve been wanting to take a linux certification for some time now. It’s been a goal, but I don’t feel I’m ready. Lately I’ve been studying a lot, trying to prepare myself and took a few practice exams.

The first pre-exam I took was a Linux+ pre-test from skillsoft, which I got a 92% on, which made me fell pretty good.

The next one I took was an LPIC test out of the back of my LPIC Exam Cram book. The LPIC is generally considered to be much harder than the linux+ exam. I needed a 70% to pass, and only got a 62%. Most of the questions I missed were RPM related or x window related.  
I’ve since studied those sections and continued to make my way through the exam cram book (I’m on page 207 of 487, reading at most 5 pages a day due to the sheer volume of information on each page).

Today I took a test off the CD that came with the book and got a 70.7%

I’m reviewing my answers now to see what needs to be improved, but this is exciting to me that had this been a real test, I would have passed.  
I plan on putting a lot more work into it still, but it definately lets me know I’m learning something.

I highly reccommend the LPIC exam cram book btw if you’re planning on doing any work with linux. flip to a random page and you’ll learn a handful of things- it’s great.
