So on our way home from getting the first ultrasound, jackie and I had the unpleasant experience ot driving down 44th street in rushour traffic. What made this different than any other day?

Abortion Protestors with giant fucking dead baby posters.

Thse are the same people who protested the passion of the christ for being too bloody. The same asswipes that forced Indiana Jones to get the first ever PG 13 because of melting people. The same fuckfaces that want to ban GTA:SA for showing two models having sex.

You know what? Fuck you, religious right, thatâ€™s goddamn unneeded. To force that shit on people who are stuck in traffic? Are you fucking sick in the head?

Jesus Christ, may god have mercy on your fucking souls for that shit.

For shame.
