November is National Novel Writing Month, also known as NaNoWriMo. Basically there’s a month-long open contest to try and write a novel that’s 50,000+ words. My friend VP has written two books like that, [Shining Star](< http://www.lulu.com/content/177354>) and [Pulling Strings](http://www.lulu.com/content/212525) (both are good, go buy them). This year I thought I’d give it a try- I have a couple of stories kicking around in the back of my head that I’d like to write some day, and I figured this would be the perfect chance to stop putting it off.  
The contest started yesterday, and I managed to get off to a great start with 4000 words on the dot- you can check my progress [here.](http://www.nanowrimo.org/eng/user/243541)

ok, now back to the important writing.
