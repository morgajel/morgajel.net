So what else can our [locationGenerator](http://morgajel.net/2013/02/02/1313 "Hey, what’s that? Part 1: The Ruins") describe? How about cows. Lots of them. A full herd of animals.

Technically it doesn’t need to be cows, or even a herd, just a large mass of animals that doesn’t constitute a military unit, which we’ll deal with later. So a herd of cows or buffalo, or it could just as easily be a flock or a pack, gaggle or parliament.

Where is the herd? what is it? what are they doing? where are they going? are they hostile or friendly? Do they see you? is there anything else around them? Why are they there?

> During your travels, you stumble across a \[herd/flock/gaggle\] of \[dozens/hundreds/thousands/countless\] \[seals/goats/cows/etc\] \[crossing the road/standing by the road/traveling down the road/standing in a field\]. They \[have/haven’t\] spotted you, and will \[likely/unlikely/probably\] act \[friendly/cautious/hostile\] towards you if you approach. The herd appears to be \[migrating/moving/grazing\] \[towards/away\] from you. In the distance you catch a \[wolf/cougar/predator\] stalking the herd. You \[can/can’t\] safely pass the herd without drawing attention to yourself.
