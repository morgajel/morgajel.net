so it sounds like the two new hires are discovering the joy of working for my old company.  
poor bastards.

SPX apparently decided to have the christmas party early in december, so I didn’t get a chance to warn them…  
here’s what they had to look forward to…

- dinner at the smithsonian
- a live band

Oh, but that wasn’t all they got- they also got the following:

- no actual food.
- sitting at the kiddie table
- staring at a tray full of sandwiches that the band got to eat
- a table from the back room when they realized there weren’t enough seats.
- no more glasses of water once the bar closed.

SPX has never really been a class act, but something you’d think they’d at least be competent enough to get a proper headcount for the entrees and make sure therewas a plate or two extra just in case- hard to believe they skimped on food when they rented the damn air and space museum to host it.
