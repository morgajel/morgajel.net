Well, sorta- they’re not new to linux, but they installed Debian on their home machines as part of a 2 month experiment.

Yojimbo is looking for a better job, and I’ve been trying to help him develop some skills that will make it easier. I’ve taught him a little perl in the past and he’s used linux at the college (EOS lab at GVSU), so it wasn’t too big of a jump. I challeneged him to use Linux for 2 months. So far we’ve got debian installed, wrangled the Nvidia drivers into place, installed NWN, and got sound working- basically he’s not far from where he was before.

Krox is Yojimbo’s roommate. He saw the fun of getting debian to work and decided to join in. He spent a lot of time in the EOS lab at GVSU, so he is no stranger to linux. So far, everything is up and running for him- video, audio, and nwn.

Learning Linux is sorta like learning a new language- you’ll learn it faster if you’re immersed. With both of them learning linux and living together, they’ll be able to help each other figure things out if I’m not available. Hopefully these two will get into it and figure out a way to make money off of it.
