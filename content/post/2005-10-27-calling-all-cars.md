So in order to keep this job, I have to be cleared for a position of public trust. This means I have to document

- Every Place I’ve lived in the last 7 years
- Every Place I’ve workd in the last 7 years
- A Contact for each one of the above
- 3 people who know me well.

So if I start asking weird questions, and you get calls from the Feds, don’t freak out- I’m not going to jail- it’s just clearance. As far as I know, I won’t have any secret information on UFOs or anything and that fact that I’m getting this isn’t secret to my knowledge- they’re just making sure I’m not a nutcase.
