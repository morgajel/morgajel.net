I’m sure I’m not the only person to notice this, but my spelling and grammar has been getting worse. I don’t think I’m the only one suffering from this problem.

I’m pretty sure I can attribute it to the internet in general, and this blog/irc in particular. Why do I blame them? Because I’ve gotten used to typing as fast as I can and hitting enter without proofreading.

With the blog, I do proofread a bit, but not nearly as much as I should- with IRC, I rarely even think if I \*should\* say it before hitting enter.

Where’s that leave me? Well, I’ve noticed that I tend to write things phonetically. What’s worse is I don’t even recognize these mistakes anymore. I wonder how many were in this little rant?
