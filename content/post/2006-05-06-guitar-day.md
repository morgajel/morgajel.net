so I got a lot of friends to play guitar in the GR area… I’m thinking I should invite them over for a “lets learn to play better” excercise. The best way to learn to play better is to play with other people- you learn new techniques, get practice, etc.

So, anyone up for such an idea? wonko? ogg? yojimbo? silver? beth? rodarmer?

when would be a good time? can we make this a weekly thing?

Post ideas…
