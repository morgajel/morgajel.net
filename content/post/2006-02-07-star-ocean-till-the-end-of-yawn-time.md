This is my first real video game review, so I’m not sure where to go with it.

You play a kid named Fayt with a sword who is being chased. There are a couple of plot twists, but for the most part the story is disjointed. Gameplay is spread between a couple of different worlds, and as you progress to the next world, they squeeze some plot in.

They could have done more with the klausians, and they could have done a LOT more with the guys chasing them in the beginning. Introducing a big bad alien species and then taking them out of the game before you fight them is sorta lame.

Also, Fayt and Maria- they’re the only 2 people in the game with blue hair, both results of an experiment… are they supposed to be twins? was that ever explained? Their hair just \*happened\* to both be blue? I think Fayt’s dad has the bluehair gene and was spreadin the love with her Maria’s mom. And what was the deal with Sophia? that felt sorta tacked on at the end. They also never explained the relationship between Mirage and Cliff. Cousins? Divorced? what the hell?

ok, back to the plot. I was actually embarassed at the MAJOR plot twist in the game- They completely ripped off a certain movie that came out around the same time.

The game kept dragging on, and the final battle with the boss was difficult, but boring.

**Pros:**  
I liked the battle system- it was an rpg, yet a button masher at the same time. Paging through the spell interface would have been a nice feature, but other than that it was pretty good.

**Cons:**  
the plotline reminded me of something the cat yacked up. level layouts, like the carnival near the end, were just painful- fight fight fight, run 3 screens to go get supplies, one more to save, and back across all 4 to get back to fighting.

also, the dialogs in the arena- for crying out loud, I don’t want to hear the same lame 15 box intro and joke every time I fight the sacred beasts- I’m trying to level up to beat the final boss! Shut the hell up!

ok, upon reading this review, I’ve decided not to do anymore.
