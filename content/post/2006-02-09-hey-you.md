Yeah you, the jackasses who decided that the middle of a crowded elevator lobby was a good place to stop and chat.

While I understand it’s of dire importantance you tell each other about what your coworkers said to annoy your other coworkers, could you please NOT STAND IN FRONT OF THE ELEVATOR CALL BUTTONS while doing it? I know there’s not much space there, with it being lunch rush and 50 other people crammed into this small space, but we all have to make sacrifices.

I hate to be a party pooper, but could you please GTFO of the way before I have to push you down so I can get back to work? There’s a whole open lobby not 20 feet away from you where could chatter- you could even spread out a bit.

Oh yeah, and thank you for convincing me to add a new category- Jerks.
