I can never remember the name of modeline for some reason- I always call it a slug. Here is the proper syntax for it as found [here](http://www.lornajane.net/posts/2011/using-modelines-in-vim):

```
/* vim: set sw=2: */
```

Now the next time I google for “Vim slug” this page will come up and I can feel dumb all over again.
