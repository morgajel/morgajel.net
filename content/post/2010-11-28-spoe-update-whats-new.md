I’ve been slowly chugging away at [SPoE](http://spoe.morgajel.com) in my free time here and there and have added a few bits that I’d like to share.

- **Welcome Page** – now displays recently modified Snippets and Reviews (although reviews are unimplemented).
- **Snippets** – Now have a publish flag to hide snippets from the public. If a snippet is unpublished, no one can review it.Â Snippet lists can be paginated now.
- **Accounts** – users can register, activate, edit, their accounts and change and reset their passwords. They can set their proclaimed experience levels in writing and reviewing, change their email address, and add IM info.
- **Annotations** – username and passwords have annotated validation, despite error handling being somewhat lacking.

Again, it’s nowhere near complete, but it’s almost to the point of being usable.
