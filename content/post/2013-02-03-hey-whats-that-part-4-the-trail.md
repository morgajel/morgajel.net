So what else can our [locationGenerator](http://morgajel.net/2013/02/02/1313 "Hey, what’s that? Part 1: The Ruins") describe? How about a trail.

There are many types of trails you can stumble upon- a trail of destruction, a trail of blood, of slime; perhaps a bandit left a trail of coins or breadcrumbs. Are there foot prints, hoofprints, sled tracks, moose tracks? Is it an animal, a humanoid, a machine or a monster? is the weather affecting it? how old is it? Is it dangerous? what makes it interesting? where does it go? where did it come from?

> During your travels, you stumble across a \[strange/odd/visible\] trail \[joining/crossing/splitting from\] your path. The trail seems to be \[footprints/tracks/dragmarks\] made in \[ mud/blood/slime/gravel/\].

You sense \[danger/foreboding/serenity/nothing/magic\] while studying the trail.
