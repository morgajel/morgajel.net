So I was wandering through del.icio.us and stumbled across [hundredpushups.com](http://hundredpushups.com), a site that supposedly helps you get in shape by getting you to do 100 pushups in a row. It lasts 6 weeks and I figured what the hell, I’ll give it a try.

My initial test was 8- I could have done more, but my lower abs weren’t used to holding the 20lbs of flab and started feeling like I was gonna have a hernia. Since I didn’t think I could complete any more with proper form, I cut off at 8. I’m not trying to impress anyone at the moment, but hopefully in 6 weeks, I’ll be able to impress people.

Today I completed [Day 1](http://hundredpushups.com/week1.html). Since I’m using column 2, I only had to do 7. I’m gonna try and do these either before jackie gets up or after she goes to sleep so I don’t feel self conscious.
