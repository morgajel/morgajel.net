Fark has a great link for a [DnD character personality test](http://fantasyherald.com/quiz/dand/index.php).  
Here’s what I came up with for me.

Neutral Good Half-Elf Ranger

Alignment:  
Neutral Good characters believe in the power of good above all else. They will work to make the world a better place, and will do whatever is necessary to bring that about, whether it goes for or against whatever is considered ‘normal’.

Race:  
Half-Elves are a cross between a human and an elf. They are smaller, like their elven ancestors, but have a much shorter lifespan. They are sometimes looked down upon as half-breeds, but this is rare. They have both the curious drive of humans and the patience of elves.

Primary Class:  
Rangers are the defenders of nature and the elements. They are in tune with the Earth, and work to keep it safe and healthy.

```
